The Thai police have also confirmed that blood was found splashed on the walls and the ground covered by pieces of human flesh. -The disfigured victim was identified as Prasit Inpathom, a frequent restaurant customer who was last seen drinking drinks there on October 21. According to the police report, Prasit suffered serious injuries in a fight with the head of the restaurant. He was hit on the head with a blunt object and had multiple knife wounds on his body. The police are now on the hunt for the suspect.-Faith of Errors: A first version of this news reflected the information published by Daily Mail that in said restaurant human flesh had been served to customers.",

Switzerland does not authorize, like most other states, any extradition or any other form of legal aid for political offences, \"he said.-He added that \"according to media information, a priori would be political offences that are accused of Catalan politics\", and \"therefore Switzerland would not process an eventual request for extradition or a request for assistance Judicial \".-Gabriel was to appear this Wednesday before the Supreme Court (TS) as investigated by rebellion in the case opened by the independence process in Catalonia, but announced today in a Swiss newspaper that will not.-In an interview on French-speaking public radio, Anna Gabriel said she is willing to ask for asylum in Switzerland, although she assumes that the judge who instructs the case can ask Bern for her extradition tomorrow. She and her lawyer in Switzerland, Olivier Peter, consider that a request from the judge would be \"illicit.\" They argue that it is being \"persecuted for political reasons\" in Spain and that \"it would not receive a fair trial\" and impartial in that country.-Gabriel, who speaks perfectly French and at the moment has only spoken with Swiss means, said today that if he stays in Switzerland he will try to resume his academic career, since he has been a professor of law in Barcelona, and that if Spain requested his extradition \"request asylum Political \"in the Alpine country.",

A decision that has generated a great deal of controversy in the last few hours. -Among the topics, not only do we find reggaeton songs, but also Spanish pop. ' Without You I am nothing ' of Amaral, ' with You ' of the song of the Madman, ' had so much to give ' of Nena Daconte or ' I hope you sit ' of Shakira are some of the songs that promote the machismo and the violence of gender according to the program of the Government of Navarra. -These songs will be banned in schools to prevent them from being a bad influence for teenagers aged 12 to 16. Teachers in the centers of the autonomous Community will not be able to use the topics included in the list in their classes. -For the moment, Dani Martín has been the only artist that appears in the list that has shown his opinion. \"It's about time you censurarais a song like ' Contigo ', written by me, dedicated to the affection that the public makes us come. Congratulations, that is the fight against machismo, that is the beginning of a value-packed education! Dani Martín, what a macho shit! \"He has written in an ironic tone on Twitter. ",

Of course, the man was arrested just to confess.-Williams was Moore's assistant and, among his occupations, was to bring him the coffee. Before more than 12 people who were present at the time of the discussion, he acknowledged that he had done it \"on hundreds of occasions\".-The discussion witnesses claim that Williams seemed to be proud of his actions. Now, he's facing a 1070-year prison sentence for 860 crimes of sexual abuse.",

Beyond that point, the association also wondered \"how a worker can prove her sexual orientation\" when it comes to being hired. \" That is why it would not be guaranteed that the offers were analyzed in ' effective competition '.-On the other hand, he pointed out that the legal framework could be disobeyed once the successful tenderer requested applicants to a job that detallasen their sexual orientation.-One of the clauses provided up to five points for companies that commit to subcontract at least 25% of the workers between people LGTBIQ. Being homosexual in Spain is already an added value.",

An old vindication of the collective that could now take body with the feminist, transsexual, inclusive (and gluten-free) government of Pedro Sánchez.-The celebration of a few days exclusively conceived in the traditional families of father and mother \"provokes discriminations and exclusions to many children and their families\", has denounced in a statement the organization StopLGBTfobia.-The Director of this observatory, Francisco Ramírez, has explained that the single-parent and Homo families are being \"completely ignored\" in these celebrations, as well as other types of families such as the host or those in which one or the Two parents and children are cared for by grandparents or other family members.-He has also ensured that celebrating these days can cause \"psychological damage to children who are excluded from a special day that all their classmates celebrate, producing self-discrimination, lack of esteem and even causing bullying, mockery and mockery for Part of other children. \"-Therefore, they have launched the campaign #MiFamiliaEs as a way of raising awareness and making society aware of the importance of coeducation in schools, affecting the inclusion and fight against discrimination and bullying, and encouraging Different schools.-The Ministry of Education could consider adopting this measure, which would end with another of the traditional festivities of our country: Father's Day or Mother's Day. So that no one will feel offended. Yes, the day of Gay Pride to continue celebrating: Lest we tachen of Fachas.",

An Islamist collective formally requested the Moroccan Government to establish ' by law ' the ' private beaches ' for the enjoyment and enjoyment of Muslim women.-\"Women disobey Allah if they get naked in front of men,\" wrote Noor Alhoda one of the organizers in the Facebook event that she herself created, claiming a beach where they can fully enjoy a space in which to bathe with freedom , without being obliged to cover their bodies, faces or heads in the midst of the heat wave that has arrived in Morocco this summer.-\"After the end of Ramadan, everyone wants to enjoy the summer holidays, but women can not enjoy the party and swimming like men,\" they point out in this call, which already has more than 3,000 followers.-The growing and recent phenomenon of macho violence and sexual harassment in the streets and beaches of Tangier is one of the main reasons for supporting and support its incitement. Less than a month ago a mother with a girl in her arms was persecuted and harassed by a group of men in one of the busiest areas of Tangier for wearing a tight dress that showed her legs. It is the daily bread on the beaches of the area, as indicated by those who claim a few kilometres of sand and sea, free of men, riveted gazes and non-pleasing words.-We can create ' recreational spaces ' for Muslim women only-Well, the for some crazy proposal has already arrived in Spain in the form of electoral candy. It should not be forgotten that, by simple geographical proximity, our country is one of the main recipients of Muslim immigration throughout the European Union.-The circles of may have picked up the glove and are already working to bring one of its citizens ' assemblies a programmatic proposition that will certainly not be free of controversy: the formation of Pablo Iglesias will study creating ' public recreational spaces ' So that Muslim women do not feel discriminated and can enjoy, fully, the extensive Spanish coast, one of the main tourist attractions of the Iberian Peninsula.-The contacts would always be coordinated with the communities governed by the white marks of can, or those municipalities with which there is a \"good political harmony\", many of them controlled by coalitions of left thanks to the pacts post After the municipal elections last May 24th.-\"Just as there are nudist beaches, or beaches specifically targeted to the gay public, beach areas could be demarcated only and exclusively for Muslim women. There is No greater demonstration of freedom than that of respecting and allowing each individual to be fully expressed in all its extent. That is the greatest demonstration of tolerance. \"-It is not the first political wink of we can to the Muslim community of our country. Last March, as published, in a rigorous news first, the editorial editor of the Mediterranean Digital, jumped to the first plans of the national press the undisguised intention of the party of Pablo Iglesias to prohibit the festivities of ' moors and Christians ', a deeply rooted national tradition which, however, was considered \"an offense and a provocation\" for the growing Islamic Group of our country. \"The celebrations of Moors and Christians have no place in democratic Spain.\"-> > > > > > We can prohibit the tradition of the ' Moors and Christians ' so as not to offend Islam",

David Sánchez Castejón was appointed new advisor to the area of culture of the Diputación de Badajoz. Don't the surnames sound surprisingly familiar? To the President of the Government also: he is his brother.-A controversial incorporation that has already been criticized, even, by the spokesman Extremadura de Can, Álvaro Jaén, who has publicly described as \"plug\" the hiring of David Sanchez as coordinator of activities of music conservatories in the area of Culture of the Diputación de Badajoz.-As we can see, this \"charge did not exist to date, the bases did not require even the title of Professor of music and there was no court, only one interview in the office of the provincial Deputy\". The Neocomunista censored that, while fighting for guarantees in the opposition, the region is a witness to \"how the brother of (Pedro) Sanchez is elected in this position.\" Reason is not lacking.-Transparency-In the regional groups of PP and citizens they also publicly doubted the viability of this controversial appointment.-The popular spokesman, Luis Francisco Sánchez Álvarez, demanded \"transparency\" and clarify \"all reasonable doubts\" for the incorporation of the new adviser, and citizens \"it is striking that the delegation has valued, as decisive, the interview made to Brother of Pedro Sánchez as part of the selection process to which 11 applicants attended. '-The Diputación de Badajoz, in the hands of the PSOE, defended in a statement that the position for which he was elected David Sanchez was created in November 2016 and that in the process followed the principles of \"publicity, equality, merit and capacity\" have been respected.-According to the institution, the attack of We can is \"gratuitous, unjustified and liar\" and assures that the purple formation \"lacks the truth\", since the post was created on November 4, 2016 and was published in the Official Gazette of the Province (BOP) on 23 December last , on the occasion of the approval of the budgets of the corporation.-«Placement Agency»-The ' signing ' as director of Begoña Gómez at EI Africa Center, a new creation center dedicated to promoting entrepreneurship and the development of social action projects in the Third World, has reopened the controversy over the placements of Sanchez, which They had a first and controversial precedent in the case of their brother.-Paul married, refused to pronounce on the subject by \"respect\", but the PP posted a message on their social networks to satirize on the \"placement agency\" of the leader of the executive: \"The placement agency\" Pedro Sanchez, president of the government \"has passed the Limits of Ferraz to place his wife, Begoña Gómez, in Instituto de Empresa».",

Of the abortion we talked another day.-In addition, the deputy Mayor regretted that Europe is producing \"a boom of the far right\" and movements that are jeopardizing the fundamentals of human rights. Not as in their beloved communist regimes and Bolivarian, which are a haven of peace and freedoms.-Ortiz has argued that immigrants must have temporary work permits and, in an interview of Catalunya Ràdio collected by Europa Press, has asked the government of Pedro Sanchez to authorize them, because you can not give the \"Welcome to boats\" and then Condemn those who come to the submerged economy.-The Aquarius, who landed in Valencia in June to more than 600 immigrants in our country, again calls for a safe port to leave 141 Africans rescued in waters of the Mediterranean. What do we bet that ends up in Spain?",

When the uprising erupted that would end the overthrow and death of the Libyan leader, the Abedi family began to come and go from the Arab country.-A source of security services questioned that Salman Abedi had fought in Libya before he was rescued. \"He did things mainly alone. Internet played a great role in their training, \"said this source to the newspaper.",

Just like that.-This has been done by the Madrid City Council of Manuela Carmena this Wednesday through an official statement.-The initiative is part of the sealed pact between the consistory, the EMT and the transexual-Spanish transsexual association.  -\"These passes will be distributed by the association between the persons users of their services, in consideration to the respective situations of social exclusion or manifest need that accredit the interested ones in relation to the exercise of their right to the Mobility and displacement. \"-\"Transsexualia is a non-profit organization that aims to promote full integration in the Society of transgender men and women, putting in place measures to ensure their full access to health, education and information resources \".-The PP also gives free passes to the metro for transgender Madrid-As strange and surreal as it may seem, the privilege of travelling for free in public transport is not an idea that emanates only from the Podemita town hall of Manuela Carmena.-The former president of the community of Madrid, the popular Cristina Cifuentes, also started a campaign in 2016 to ensure free transportation to all Madrid transexuals. In its case, 38 annual free movement passes by Metro. -The votes of the LGBT lobby increasingly count, and their support can be decisive and the balance to be decanted in an election.-It should be recalled that in March of last year the new \"Law of transsexuality\" of Madrid, which imposes the theory of gender in the public and private school of the capital of Spain, was carried out. All the groups were in favor, except for the PP, which abstained.-Then, they still wonder why the People's Party has lost much of its electorate.-\"They gave them a choice between dishonor or war, Elegísteis dishonor... and now you will have war.\" [Winston Churchill, British Prime Minister, 1874-1965]",

It has changed and deformed both society that natural thought is now taken as a malicious and sexist deviation.-Sensitivity touches the opposite pole of reality. They are, as they say, odious. For this reason, the ' extremists of feminism ' do not stop burning social networks against true feminism. And to look for the comparison between a guitar and the abuse of man's power to the detriment of a woman is undoubtedly twisted and degrading. \"Yes, you've guessed: guitars are sexist. It is No coincidence that the guitar is shaped like a woman, but a way in which men reflect their power over us. Playing guitar is like abusing a woman you hold with one hand and the thumbs with the other \"writes @sediciosas on her Twitter, a feminist account with more than 13,200 followers.-Seriously, don't you think he's taking the thing a little too far?-The proposals against true feminism slash the tragedy in today's society. So they let a glimpse of a spirit of destruction, not of union. Therefore, on 8 March will cease to be International Women's Day, to become the International Day of ' Feminazi '.-People with strange thoughts or who try to carry the subjects from one to the other have existed all their lives. In recent times it seems that the rare are those who do not think so.",

They are at your service and must be trained to guard the house, take care of the cattle or go hunting. ISIS leaders have launched a ' jihad ' against our company animals worldwide.-The Spanish authorities are already investigating the recent deaths from poisoning of more than a dozen dogs in Lérida, one of the areas with the greatest Salafist presence in our country.-The wave of canine deaths coincides with the campaign launched by Muslims in the network and numerous Islamic blogs based in Spain. All dogs have died of poisoning or beheaded.-This summer, two Islamic groups based in Lérida have already asked the officials to regulate the presence of animals in public spaces to avoid \"offending the Muslims\". They demand that their presence be banned on public transport or that they can share space with people outdoors.-As they argue, dogs \"violate religious freedom\" and their right to live according to the principles of the Quran.-Islam forbids having dogs, and the punishment for him who does it is to lose one or two of his qiraats of his hasanaat (good deeds) of each day. An exception has been made in the case of hunting dogs, trained to guard the cattle or to watch the house. These are literal words collected in the Islamqa.info Islamic Forum.-Saudi Arabia has recently announced that it is punishable by the death penalty that defies Sharia law and decides to have dogs at home. It did so through the President of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the prevention of Vice, known as Muttawa or religious police, an authority in the country.-\"Undoubtedly the dog is an unclean animal.\" \"Not only can it not be taken out to walk, not even be held within the walls of home or in the garden itself.\"-Lérida is one of the cities with a higher rate of Muslim population, already above 20% of the census.-' All Europe will be Muslim: we have many children and they prefer to have a dog or a fish '",

As every 2nd of January, the Andalusian City Council commemorates with great solemnity the victory of the Catholic monarchs and the expulsion, after centuries of reconquest, of the Moslem armies of the peninsula.-After almost ten years of war, in 1491, the Catholic monarchs put siege to the capital of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. His fall was already a matter of time.-According to the story, Isabel I of Castile not only intended to conquer the city, but to go even further and end, once and for all, with the Islamic power in the peninsula, which extended for more than 800 years.-When he entered Malaga (1487) He closed his port and the possible military aid that could come from the Muslim kingdoms of the Maghreb. The taking of Baza, at the other end of the kingdom, marked another turning point in the offensive.-Granada resisted them and it was in the area where Fernando and Isabel concentrated all their efforts. The pressure of the combined forces of Castile and Aragon was directed on the capital in order to end the resistance by a single blow. They planted their camp in what we now know as Santa Fe.-After 18 months of terrible siege, the end came by hunger, by the military pressure and, according to historical sources, by the bribe to several notable nasrid courtiers, who promised to preserve their properties and their social position and give them certain Mercedes. On January 2, 1492, the armies of Sultan Boabdil surrendered and were expelled from the country.-The last stronghold of Muslim power in Spain disappeared since the year 711. The reconquest was over. The unification of the Spanish kingdoms was already a fact. He had just written one of the most glorious pages in our history.-However, as with the ' Discovery of America ', the controversy continues to accompany the one that should be a date of celebration and fraternization between Spaniards. We continue to be ashamed of our own past.-Open grenade platform calls for ban on ' taking grenade '-In parallel with the official acts, the ' Open Granada platform ' will celebrate this year a new edition of the alternative ' Toma No, Mariana yeah ' with the Arab Foundation, this time around the figure of the poet Federico García Lorca, who will claim to To show their rejection of a celebration that they consider \"xenophobic\" and \"anachronistic\".-The events, which will start at 11.00 hours, will feature the presence of Hispanist and expert in Lorca Ian Gibson, in addition to a poetic reading by Ángeles Mora, a concert of Andalusian music and a flamenco recital by the singer Juan Pinilla.-The spokesman for the platform, Francisco Vigueras, has recalled that García Lorca was contrary to the celebration of the Take and spoke \"of the Gypsy, the Black, the Jew and the Moorish that we all carry inside.\" The opposite, he said that he advocates the celebration of the takeover, which implies \"the rupture of Democratic coexistence\", as it has become a celebration that uses the \"far right grenadine\" to sing slogans \"xenophobic\", \"Islamófobas\" and \"racist\".-For this reason, the platform has reclaimed the Granada City Council to eliminate the celebration of the take as it is currently conceived and to turn it into a \"festival of cultures\". In addition, it bets that on January 2 cease to be local party, in favor of May 26, day of Mariana Pineda. In fact, according to Vigueras, on May 26th was the local festival in Granada before Francoism, and it was the dictator who decided to change it to January 2 to celebrate the taking of the city by the Catholic Monarchs, a party that \"is no longer sustainable in democracy \".-The bases of We can in Granada qualify of ' genocide ' the ' taking of Granada '-Another of the groups that already openly showed their rejection of the celebration of the ' take of Granada ' were the circles of can, with ample presence and municipal representation.-The bases of the Neocomunista formation in the city qualified the victory, through its official Twitter account, of ' fascist celebration ' and ' genocide ' against the Andalusian people, and demanded that Spain ask for forgiveness to Islam.",

He adds that \"he only seeks to humiliate the teachers free of charge\" and \"fuelling the hatred against Muslims in general and Islam in particular.\"-Sel-Lam has emphasized that many students from the center of the UNED in Melilla are Muslim and wear a veil, a garment that many women usually use in the city. For this reason, he considered that it would be \"an affront\" to invite \"a retamed Islamophobic\" to acts such as the presentations of books to which he has attended for years to come.",

There is only law for the House, as the streets begin to resemble those urban jungles that appear in some American footage. Yesterday, a group of maintainers tried to raid the premises of the Local Police in Benicarló (Castellón) to recover the confiscated counterfeit goods. The first thing to ask is what concept they have of our country to be mocked so much of our rules and act in such a violent way.-The tension was increasing when dozens of sub-Saharan shouted and rebuked the intimidating police officers and the Civil guard who were at the gates of the police station. They were reclaimed to have returned the counterfeit merchandise they sell at the port.-The testimony on Twitter of a local police officer in Benicarló is sufficiently revealing of the chaos that one lives in the municipality: \"The Beings of Light (maintainers) that we sell the progression try to storm the premises of the local police of Benicarló to Recover the seized merchandise. Police officers face the lack of judicial and institutional support. We fight alone. \"-Another agent has confessed that they do not dare to identify the maintainers in the public thoroughfare, to know their legal situation, \"because they get aggressive and in the end the people on come to defend them and to rebuke the police\"",

            "text_joined": "The aspiring president of Carles Puigdemont's cover, is well known for his activity in social networks and, above all, for his schizophrenic tweets written between 2011 and 2015 against Spain and what our country represents. However, in 2016 decided to delete all traces of his past Tuitero and create a new account and profile in which we have also found some controversial pearls that allow us an idea of the true profile of the new applicant to tenant of the Plaza Sant Jaume.-Already in the Eighties he wrote in a pamphlet that the Autonomous University of Barcelona is preserved with the differences between the so-called Catalan and Spanish races. They drank from the same sources as Pujol and Barrera to illuminate such texts:--It has been considerable despite the fact that the influence of Arabs and Moors, which have been mixed with the autochthonous ones, especially in the South, is not definitive, giving a crossbreeding that is recognized by external morphological characters (darker and curly hair and more skin color Dark and that it is due to a greater pigmentation power and not to the sun), in addition, the anterior mandibular angle is inferior to that of Catalan. It can be considered Spanish aal as an element of the white race in a frank evolution towards the racial component African and Semitic (Arab).--The IQ of a Spaniard and a Catalan according to the statistics published by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, gives a clear advantage to the Catalans.--The progressive Spanish racial degradation can be spread to the Catalans because of the strong immigration. The fruits can be seen if we observe the difference of character between the man of the field, not contaminated by the Spanish saga, and that of the cities. The working and European character of Catalan is a well-disganduling and pro-African psychic factor of Spanish.--For all that we have to consider that the Catalan racial configuration is more purely white than Spanish and therefore Catalan is superior to Spanish in the racial aspect.-– \"The Spaniards in Catalonia are like energy: they do not disappear, they transform themselves.\"-– \"French and Spanish share the same annihilating conception of the nations that live in their states.\"-– \"Be joking. Gentlemen, if we continue here a few more years we run the risk of ending as crazy as the Spaniards themselves. \"-– \"We Catalans go in private cars and we pay for everything. We don't do like the Spaniards do. \"-– \"Above all, what is surprising is the tone, the rudeness, the Spanish Pijería, the feeling of filth.\"-– \"We Catalans vote and the Spaniards come here to watch over us. Get out of here at once. Let us live in peace! \"-– \"Shame is a word that the Spaniards have removed from their vocabulary for years.\"-– \"Hearing Albert Rivera speak of morality is like hearing the Spaniards speak of democracy.\"-– \"The Spaniards only know how to plunder.\"--[to the PSC] \"poor, speak Spanish as the Spanish.\"- Apology of \"Nosaltes Sols\"-Torra renews the racist tradition and vindicates groups like Estat Català and Nosaltes Sols, \"Pioneers of the Independence\". \"They had always been there, kept the flame of the memory by a small but most faithful number of followers, far, however, of the majority catalanism, which transited on another sidewalk\", wrote in an article (2014) in the newspaper the Punt-Avui. And he added: \"In these hundred years in which Catalanism sighed to find a rift in which to fit a common project for Spain, they had already realized the absurdity of this madness under monarchies, republics, dictatorships or democracies. When the budgets and pacts of governability were passed year after year, they warned that Spain Expoliaba us. When the demonstrations shouted \"Som una born\", they pointed out that a nation without a state is a safe wreck. When for some, caught in the Spanish web, everything seemed so complicated, they instead posed simple and clear arguments: freedom, democracy, social justice, Catalan state.-The flame of the characters who admires Torra is still very alive. Proof of this is the Moviment Identitari Català, who hastened to congratulate the character without disguising his enthusiasm. They are the same that gather every April 28 in front of the portal of the Badia Brothers to sing \"Els Reapers\" and to hear a few words of some leader of relief. Torra has been tanned as a speaker in those kinds of acts.",

Among them, freedom and religious equality, \"sentence.-The Iranian believes that the more than 1.8 million Muslims already living in Spain are \"discriminated against by State policy.\" A reason of faith that collides frontally with its conception of reality.-\"We watch over the well-being of Muslims throughout Europe.

            "text_joined": "A father or mother in Germany is angry at the country's march and have their own views on issues such as Angela Merkel's immigration policies, multiculturalism, or increased criminality at the hands of foreign refugees.-When you get home, as millions of people around the world do, one or the other unleashes your tension on Facebook. That same night, or the next day, or in the interval of the following week, officials of the Jugendamt (German institution in charge of the protection of the Children), accompanied by police officers, have the legal faculty to be able to transfer to the children of the \"Racist\" surfer to a children's re-education center, protected by the state. The following consequence of the \"bad\" use of the expressive freedom, or of expressing opinions considered \"racist\", according to the criterion of the German authorities, will surely be the loss of the custody of the children, that could be given for adoption to families Nothing suspicious of harboring doubts about the official morality imposed by the Masters of the moment.-A publication of German lawyers has dared to denounce these measures of Orwellian nature. It announces that there have already been many cases of children snatched from their parents, all of them native Germans. Among the causes that have led to the loss of child custody, criticism of immigration and ideological indoctrination in schools is cited as the most numerous.-The same publication details that, once separated from their parents, the state takes charge of the temporary re-education of the children, who are indoctrinated on the ideas related to the process of social engineering assumed by the majority of European States , including the gender ideology, the admission of homosexuality as a preferential sexual option, the acceptance of multiculturality as advantageous for the Germans and the imposition of an alternative morality in matters relating to the family, religion , national sentiments and attachment to tradition, among others.-Many German parents have already denounced this \"strategy of terror\" that has been set in motion and of which the mass media is barely speaking.-The complainants also refer to the \"coercive environment\" that lives within the families of the country, as evidenced by the fact that parents do not dare to comment on issues of public interest in the presence of their children. It underlines that JUGENDAMT officials regularly attend schools and daycare centres to elicit information to children about their parents ' views on certain subjects.-As you can see, the repression for the implementation of the globalist agenda, even using the weakest and most vulnerable sector of the population, is already exhibited without masks or disguises in Angela Merkel's Germany. Even in the German Democratic Republic of the Stasi, much less in the third Reich, it had never been so far gone.",

            "text_joined": "The security incident occurred at the Prat airport in Barcelona at half past three in the afternoon of October 7th. Albert Rivera, leader of the Citizens party, must travel to Madrid. Once in the airport security checkpoint, when passing under the arc, the machine decided that it played a random control.-The president of the Orange formation, instead of acting as one more citizen, and submitting to compulsory random control, allowed his bodyguards to prevent the Prat's private security officers from doing their job.- According to the digital Catalunnyapress, the security members of Rivera refused to have the politician pass the \"trace test\" that looks for in the suitcase, the clothes and the skin of the traveler traces of explosive material.-One of Rivera's bodyguards told them that as an agent of the national Police, he was in charge of the situation. Far from authorizing the Spanish police, the airport vigilantes responded that if the test was not carried out, they should proceed to identify the National police officer with his plaque number as established by the Protocol of action in these cases.-According to the Catalunyapress, an altercation began with a strong discussion between the bodyguards and security guards who have been denounced by a trade union alternative. After a moment of relative calm and when it seemed that it was all over and with Albert Rivera inside the plane, the escorts not satisfied with the performance of the agents of the airport, returned to the arch of control and one of them, in front of the rest of travelers who waited to embark, rebuked the vigilantes saying that \"they had interfered in a Operational \". Always according to the medium quoted, the escort of Albert Rivera \"warned\" the members of security of the airport: \"Next time I put the handcuffs to you\".-Quoted to declare airport workers-The company responsible for private security in El Prat is Trablisa and acts under the supervision of the Guardia Civil. Far from explaining and lowering tensions, the Spanish national Police have denounced the workers and have been summoned at the police station on October 25 at 9.30.-Trace Test-\"The objective of this Community regulation is to increase the inspection of passengers and their hand baggage in safety controls with equipment for detecting substances not allowed inside the aircraft. In this way, if explosives, liquids have been handled, the machine detects it immediately as the control consists of a last generation scanner. \"-Update:-It was not drug control, only explosives as reported by the trade union alternative of Barcelona in a statement.-As the BOE collects, the ETD is: a technological system or a combination of different technologies capable of detecting negligible, and indicating by an alarm, the presence of explosive materials contained in the baggage or other items subject to analysis.-After having made public the trade union alternative communiqué of Barcelona clarifying that the proof was only of explosives we publish the updating of the information and holder.",

            "text_joined": "   The President of the Spanish section of Amnesty International (AI), Alfonso López Borgóñez, explained that his organization does not consider ETA a terrorist band because, as he said, there is no international agreement on the definition of the concept of Terrorism. -   It has also shown in favour of an approach of prisoners ETA to Basque prisons when the inmates request it individually and has advocated for investigating what it has called \"human rights violations\" by the forces and bodies of safety authority of the State.  -   \"We cannot define as a terrorist this group or any other because we lack that global common element of the possibility of defining people as terrorists. It is not the fault of amnesty, but in any case, of people who do not agree on the definition, \"said López Borgóñez during his participation in the Forum of the New Society (New Economy Forum).-   When asked specifically why IA does not consider ETA a terrorist group, he explained that \"there is a problem with terrorist terminology.\" \"The word is not the same in each country, there is no international convention in which it is defined. In each country is a different issue that affects people differently, \"he argues. -   \"As they are practices on which each government legislates, when talking about a war on terror all governments are fully in favor because they are the ones who say what terrorism is, so it is enough for any leader to say that something is Terrorism so that it is framed in a standard. \"-   From there, he says that it would look bad that, \"if governments agree and are able to draft legislation, Amnesty International will be able to define from an international perspective the groups committing terrorist acts based on that Def Initiated International. \" -   As for the situation of the prisoners ETA has shown supporter that \"if the prisoners, individually, ask to be near their place of residence, they must be granted.\" \"What cannot be is that they ask for associations or friends. If these cases occur, international standards are clear: people have the right to be near their place of origin, \"he adds. -   It has also argued that \"there can be no impunity for the serious human rights abuses of ETA, but human rights violations committed by the forces and security corps should also be investigated, as recommended by the Rapporteur of the UN for torture and various international bodies. \"",

They did so by using the official fire trucks and their uniforms in a clearly challenging attitude and in front of the hotels where the agents were staying.-And since then they have not stopped their efforts and have organized themselves. assemblies, clandestine meetings (even during the service) and design of future actions mark the day-to-day of most of the firefighters operating in Catalonia and who are willing to \"fight for the Republic\", as they argue. They want to move into action and arm themselves (for the time being without firearms, to which they still do not have access) but violence is a way they want to use.-There is some police concern about the development of events. The Catalan firefighters count so far with all the free way in their dark undemocratic and violent intentions. In addition, they enjoy the sympathy of the operational commands of the Mossos d ' Quadra. The Catalan police will not stop them in their efforts: look the other way.-They are already a kind of \"outpost\" of a ' guerilla Catalana '. In fact, in their official vehicles they show it and they do not hide a violent warning in their lettering: ' Bombers in Lluita ', said in Castilian, \"firefighters in struggle\". And so they look dozens of trucks throughout Catalonia for the joy of the Carles Puigdemont, and company.-Trucks and fire vehicles that also cover in their plates the E of Spain and instead put a sticker with the initials ' cat '.",

Surely someone has told you a similar anecdote and you have been in pictures. How can you drink hot water to quench your thirst instead of taking it cold or even icy as you like in the middle of summer? Well, there is a study published in the European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical Research that speaks of five risks.-It interferes with digestion. Believe it or not, this is the case according to this study, which says verbatim that it may be \"unfavorable to the digestive tract.\" This is why many people always believe that it is not a good idea to drink water after food and that it should only be taken while the food is being taken. The study delves into the question by explaining that, by drinking very cold water, the body devotes energy to regulating body temperature rather than digesting food.-Fattening. The same study still dislikes us. He also points out that the habit can become fattening. The key is based on research that too cold water can harden fat from consumed foods and thus create fat deposits in the intestine. We repeat that it is the European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical Research that says it, Ojo.-It can cause sore throat. Well, well. Here is a warning that we have been hearing for years and years and to which we have never made the slightest case. Well, apparently it's true. \"Drinking cold water helps to form an extra mucus in the body, which can make our body more prone to catch a cold.\" What we lacked.-It can cause dehydration. That is to say, to provoke the opposite effect that we seek when we drink a glass of cold water. What happens in this case is that it causes a contraction of the blood vessels, which can lead to the favor of dehydration. So surprising and because of a too low temperature of H2O.-It affects the immune system. When it seemed that nothing worse could happen to us because of the cold water intake, we found another side effect. Apparently, it also causes a fall in the heart rate, according to another study prepared by the Taiwan Institute of Traditional Medicine. Maybe we'll think about it next time before we drink a glass of water from the fridge.",

In this case, a BMW valued at 75,000 euros with satellite navigation, said, \"to facilitate the way to the gates of heaven.\" -Despite the actual debate generated in the publication of the Nigerian newspaper Naij, which reported this burial, doubts about veracity grew rapidly. -Not being able to contact with the man or finding more images of this act, some pointed to that it belonged to a film, so it has generated a debate on whether the scene is real or not, as it seems.",

At the door, he barely holds out for a few seconds. The stench of shit gets inside the body. The citizens ' headquarters (Cs) in Hospitalet (Barcelona) is a favorite objective of the independentists. It is the most attacked of the orange Formation in all Spain: 12 rounds since its opening in the year 2015, the last one on day of Sant Jordi (April 23). Nine of them using fecal feces. \"It is degrading,\" laments Miguel García, spokesman for Cs in Hospitalet.-The second municipality of Catalonia in inhabitants is not a particularly radical stronghold. But for the positions of citizens it has become a hell. They spend more time without being able to use their headquarters than in it. Every few months, hooded people dump buckets of animal feces against it, as the security cameras reveal. \"The smell disables the seat for a month. It's impossible to be inside. When the stench goes, they attack us again. I think this is violence, ' Garcia argues. -The members of Cs de Hospitalet will not forget the Sant Jordi of 2018. Hours after the attack to their headquarters, while they were in their tent as every year, a hooded with yellow ribbon came up to her. \"Nazi dogs, we're going to kill you,\" was his greeting. He hung himself from the tent, folded it, knocked the table down a kick, threw a kick at a gentleman, whom he never reached, and ran away. The Mossos managed to stop him. They put a complaint. Another. -\"We live in grievances and humiliation,\" laments Garcia. \"But we are aware that we have to fight because if not they [the independenceists] have won.\" The smell of shit still invades him. \"Graffitis calling us fascists do not like you, but you clean them at the moment. It doesn't degrade you. But fecal feces... ' They have not calculated how much money they have spent over the years to repair each attack. They believe that the three most serious (facade and broken crystals and sprinkled with a strong smell product) can be around 3,000 euros. -Garcia thinks a few seconds in search of why this fixation against them and their headquarters. They see us as enemies. We defend a way of doing politics, of country. They refuse to vote in Parlament initiatives that condemn this type of violence. They don't because violence is part of their life, their message and strategy. We condemn all kinds of violence. ' -Think again. Avoid generalizing. \"Not all independentists are violent.\" And remember that Monday, with its headquarters full of shit, a person with a yellow ribbon walked past and stopped. \"I can't even see you, I don't want you in painting, but this is degrading. I do not share it, ' he told Garcia, who recognizes that ' we must not criminalize all. But it is the guilt of the one who encourages it. -The team of citizens in Hospitalet is dawning every morning with the uncertainty of what they will find in their headquarters. Also the neighbors of the building, tired of withstanding acts vandalism and smells pests every little time. \"The neighbors are very tired,\" Garcia acknowledges. \"They come down to complain.\" Some have asked them to leave. They fear that what today is a bucket of shit tomorrow is a Molotov cocktail. We can't leave. That's passing the ball to other neighbors. The full democracy is to be able to settle where one wants».-Garcia always returns to an argument: \"The independentists excuse the violence.\" He suffered it in a personal way. A year and a half ago I was in a tent distributing leaflets at a flea market. One person approached. \"I'm going to kill you.\" Hit him in the face and on the side. He broke his glasses and provoked a partial rupture of ligament in the knee that still drags. We asked him to leave. He let go of the two dogs he wore, and he took a beating, \"he recalls. When he left, he still pulled down his pants to touch his testicles. He's pending trial. The D.A. asks for three years for hate crimes. -Garcia, like so many other constitutionalist positions in Catalonia, has changed his life. He's stopped doing things, altered habits. \"I, Strange is the day they do not insult me.\" Being with his wife on a terrace, taking something, he has been called \"fascist\", \"Nazi\"... On more than one occasion they have gone without finishing what they had asked for. His wife now checks the terraces from a distance to see if they can sit or not. With some neighbors, those who even entered his house, no longer spoken. \"It's violent when you cross the elevator. That passive violence is palpable, the looks of hatred. \" -Garcia promises to keep cleaning shit up. We can't leave him. If we do, we've lost the battle for freedom. This gives us more strength to fight. Catalan society has to be free. It is necessary to stop the soufflé and to coexist».",

            "text_joined": "The magistrate who was removed from the Gürtel case for his affinity to the PP will be the next president of the Criminal Chamber of the national hearing to replace Fernando Grande-Marlaska. This has been agreed by the plenary of the General Council of the Judiciary, which has chosen Concepción Espejel with the support of 11 of the 21 votes.-Espejel was to be the president of the trial for the Gürtel case until his own colleagues in the room he is now going to chair voted favorably to the challenge posed by private accusations and backed by the prosecution. Next to her, Magistrate Enrique López was also separated. In both cases, because their affinity to the PP jeopardized the appearance of impartiality in a cause in which the party was involved. -In front of the 11 votes of Espejel, Judge Manuela Fernandez Prado has achieved eight, by one of magistrate Fermín Javier Echarri and another of Judge Carmen lame.-The central element to remove Espejel from all the trials related to Gürtel was that in his day he was appointed vocal of the CGPJ on the proposal of the Popular party. And they have been the votes of the vowels proposed by the PP who have aupado now to the presidency of the Penal Chamber.-In addition to the vote of the president of CGPJ, Carlos Lesmes, Espejel has received the support of 10 members nominated for the PP proposal (Ángeles Carmona, Nuria Díaz, Juan Manuel Fernández, Rafael Fernández Valverde, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, Carmen Llombart, José María Macías, Juan Martínez Moya, Gerardo Martínez Tristán and Wenceslas Olea). Only one vowel proposed by the PP (Vicente Guilarte) has been unmarked and has voted for Echarri.-The support to Manuel Fernandez Prado comes from the seven vowels proposed by the PSOE (Roser Bach, Mar Cabrejas, Victoria Correa, Álvaro Cuesta, Clara Martínez de Reagia, Rafael Mozo and Pilar Sepúlveda) and the proposal by IU (Concepción Sáez). The vote to lick it has been the vowel proposed by the PNV (Enrique Lucas)-Espejel was until now president of one of the four sections that make up the Chamber of the Penal. According to the Council, the magistrate was born in 1959 and entered the judicial race in January 1983, being his first judicial destinations the courts of District of Vinaroz (Castellón) and Reus (Tarragona).-On 21 November 1986 he took office as judge of first instance and instruction of Valls (Tarragona), in which he remained until June 1987, when he was promoted to the category of magistrate. In July of that same year she was appointed judge of the Provincial Court of Tarragona and in September 1990 she became the President of the second section of that hearing.-From July 1995 to December 1999 was a judge of the provincial Court of Segovia, from where he became the president of the Audiencia Provincial of Guadalajara, a position for which was appointed by the plenary of the CGPJ in December 1999. In September 2008, she was appointed a member of the General Council of the Judiciary, a position in which she ceased in December 2013.-Reinstated in the active service in January 2014, Concepción Espejel moved to the seat of President of the second section of the Criminal Chamber of the National Court, destination in which it continues today.",

            "text_joined": "The Spanish Minister of Economy, Luis de Guindos, has gone very badly in the classification of European ministers of economy that just published Financial Times to be located in the last square, the 19, just after the headlines in the same field of Hungary, Gyorgy Matolcsy, and Greece, Yannis Stournaras. It is the German Wolgang Schäuble who leads the list, as he already did in 2010. Last year he won the Swedish Anders Borg.-The relative position of Spain has worsened with respect to the list of 2011, in which the then Minister of Economy, Elena Salgado, remained in position 13. Underneath it had Austria, France, Denmark, Hungary, Italy and Greece. His final note was 13, although in credibility was 15, but in politics went to 9.-In the case of Guindos, the global note is 19, in politics 18, in economy with 17 and in credibility 19. The newspaper stresses that Spanish is not the only European minister who has had to deal with recession and unemployment, although some of the economic leaders of these countries such as Ireland, Italy or Portugal improve with respect to last year.-In the specific case of Guindos, the financial newspaper draws attention to the \"complicated institutional framework\" in which it performs its work, in reference to the division between the areas of finance, in the hands of Cristóbal Montoro, and economy.-Financial Times recognizes that Guindos is an experienced economist, has fluent English and is the largest international profile of both, but points out that \"there remains a high degree of frustration for the division of Labor, whose critics believe it has damaged More the government's ability to communicate clearly and coherently with investors from other European capitals. \"-The rotary reference of the City has been doing this classification for seven years. To do so, it rewards those who have found the balance between economic growth and strong public finances, both nationally and internationally. It also analyses whether the respect for financial markets has been gained, although it admits that all of them are arbitrary and subjective elements that may not satisfy everyone.-\"Guindos has not had a good start,\" said Sony Kapoor, one of the experts that the FT considers as the market's judges. Jacques Depla, professor at the Toulouse Business School, believes that his main flaw is that he \"has consistently underestimated the gravity of the housing bubble and the crisis.\"",

            "text_joined": "At noon on Friday the 20th, while the newly insured Trump pronounced his inaugural speech, the new White House quickly changed hands, analogue and digitally. President Obama's Twitter account became Trump's, and the same thing happened with the White House website, which quickly placed a photo of the new representative on the cover. But that wasn't the only change. In addition to varying and substantially cutting the links to the \"issues\" of the new government — issues featured on the Obama web, such as climate change policy, Cuba, or the nuclear pact with Iran were eliminated — there is another button that disappeared: \"in Spanish.\"-This link linked to the presidency's Spanish-language website and in which, in addition to the main page topics, special interests of the Hispanic community were highlighted, such as Obama's executive actions to temporarily regularize hundreds of Thousands of undocumented youth, the deferred action program known as DACA.-During Obama's two mandates, the White House also held a blog in Spanish with topics of specific interest to the Hispanic community, from immigration issues, to normalization of relations with Cuba, or the economic crisis in Puerto Rico.-Despite the new president's patent predilection for Twitter as a means of communication — in addition to his new official account continues to maintain and use his private — the Spanish version of the White House account has also been paralyzed. The last tweet in Spanish is January 13th, under the account still in the hands of Obama.-Nor is there at the moment, as there was in the Obama era, a press spokesperson specifically dedicated to Spanish-language media and topics of Hispanic interest.-That Hispanics are not a priority for the new President became clear during the long election campaign, in which he demonized Latin American immigrants and put the main country of origin of the Hispanic community of the U.S., Mexico against the ropes. The only expression in Spanish that the then Republican candidate used was the contemptuous bad men he referred to, during the last presidential debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton, to refer to \"illegally dangerous\" immigrants who have promised Deport.-Trump also criticized one of his opponents, Jeb Bush, for speaking Spanish during the campaign.-\"We have a country where, if you want to integrate, you have to speak English. We need to have integration to have a country. I'm not the first to say this. This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish, \"he said during a Republican debate in September 2015. A long year and an electoral victory later, it doesn't look like Trump changed his mind.",

Students of first of the ESO of an institute of Gijón have been obliged to read a book that speaks about the creation of the Asturian state and shows the roadmap to follow to achieve it.-The reading is titled \"Faer Asturias\" (\"Hacer Asturias\"). According to OKDIARIO, this is a story about \"linguistic politics and the frustrated construction of Asturian nationalism\". The author is Patrick W. Zimmerman.-Zimmerman soon reveals his thesis and ensures that Asturias is a \"different nation to Spain\" and that thinks otherwise is \"a spanishist.\" \"This is a province in northwestern Spain with a history, culture, language, and a differentiated economic base from the rest of Spain,\" says the manual.-\"In the Spanish state, the imposition of a centralized vision of national identity, the ' Spain one, big and free ' will be the solution of Franco's dictatorship to violent internal conflicts,\" continues Zimmerman, who stresses that Asturias has a climate and Geography \"very different from the burnt and arid south of Spain\".-\"The Romanization of the Celtibéricas tribes of Asturias and Galicia was only partial (...) It was also minimal the influence of Muslim Spain, being the only sign of significant presence of the moors the occupation of the port of Gijón, \"he stresses.-The book also has a gap for ETA and is that according to the author the violent nature of Basque nationalism and support to the terrorist band among the population \"are due to the persistence in the region of ancestral forms of culture.\"",

I was in a state of shock, I began to cry [...] Weeping, sobbing, with uncontrollable weeping and a mental anguish of the kind that can only be experienced by those who have seen their lives destroyed by a war, \"he says in his story, during which he refers to the father As \"the donor\" and the State of pregnancy as \"diagnosis\".-After three days he \"discovered\" that he could not bring another man into the world. Lana writes: \"I don't hate men, I hate patriarchy, in what men and even some women become. I wasn't going to let that happen to my kids. The chances of it were greater if he was a child. \"-Despite the great stir that his decision has caused in public opinion, Lana says that if she were to be in the same position again, \"I would do it again in the blink of an eye.\" \"I can't believe some of the emails that have been sent to me, are there really people who want my death to choose what to do with my own body? That is characteristic of a mentally disturbed individual, \"he said.-A clandestine bus in the Orwellian world of Cifuentes-A feminist calls for \"killing men and baby boys\" -Swedish ' feminist ministers ' surrender to Islam-Six reasons to reject the rental bellies explained by a feminist",

It all began when the detainee entered, after midnight, to the aforementioned club of Alterna. He asked for a drink and then a girl approached him and started to give him conversation \"the girl was very nice and pleasant, we connected from the beginning. I took my best jokes and the girl laughed with everyone, it was clear that had linked \"explains the client with still face of disbelief.  After a little chat the girl invited him to go to one of the rooms where they consummated the sexual act, \"it was not something professional, it was noticeable that there was something special between us\" argues.-The premises demanded a total of €148, €28 of the consumptions and €120 in concept of the services provided by the girl. The customer paid their drinks but refused to pay the €120 for the service arguing that clearly had linked so the local was forced to call the Civil guard who was detained the client. \"I am sure there is love, I hope to return Aquedar with it\"",

            "text_joined": "Last Saturday took place an unpleasant incident in the well-known Swedish furniture store Ikea installed in a municipality near the Asturian city of Oviedo.-A client was expelled from the store after he got caught doing his needs in one of the showrooms. Ikea decided not to denounce the client, but has denied access to any of its facilities. \"It took 20 minutes with an impressive stomach ache. I tried to find a bathroom but that's a maze and I had no choice but to do it where I could. \" The entire Ikea plant had to be evicted by the strong smell so the store estimates a loss of about €130,000. \"We are not going to take legal action against the customer, but please do not re-appear in any of our facilities,\" explains Jordi Muñoz, communications director at Ikea.-The bathroom where the Lord made his needs had to be destroyed and the Ikea store in Oviedo will remain closed around two weeks, time necessary for its decontamination.",

These controls will double in the whole Spanish territory highlighting even more in the tourist areas in order to deter the drivers who drink take the car and so our roads are safer.-One of the drawbacks of increasing controls is the important expenditure that the Civil guard has to assume as the annual security budgets are already closed until next year they would not receive any more money. That is why the Guardia Civil will be obliged to collect the mouthpieces of the breathalyzers from next September 1 in order to cover this increase in spending. It has been determined therefore that drivers who undergo a control of sobriety should pay the amount of €1 per nozzle and €2 in case they give positive. These amounts must be paid instantly for what is recommended to drivers who have change because if the driver does not pay this new rate at the time of control would face a penalty of up to €50. -\"It is important that drivers take into account that we do all this for their safety, and they will carry the mouthpiece of remembrance,\" explains the spokesman for the Guardia Civil. You will also be given the possibility for drivers to contribute their own mouthpiece so they will not be charged this new rate.",

For drivers traveling alone will not be taken into account this, but those who are accompanied must pass the test of sobriety so that at least one of the companions can count as alternative driver. \"We believe that it is the safest way to drive, no one knows if the driver can pass something during the journey and it is good that there is always a co-pilot available\" explains Alberto Bermúdez, director of communication of the DGT.-The new measure will be launched from next July 1 in order that this summer we can have safer roads in our country.",

With this measure the government intends to lower the number of unemployed even more since the one who is not working is fulfilling the military service. They must therefore comply with the Mili all those unemployed who have refused a job in the INEM and have an age between 18 and 50 years, regardless of their sex or if they have already complied with the military service previously. Citizens who are obliged to go to the military will not receive any financial compensation for this, but the Ministry of Defence must take care of its support, which will mean an increase in expenditure calculated at about 49 million euros. -The new Unemployment Act will enter into force from September of this year and the government expects that it will be able to achieve full employment before the end of the current legislature.

            "text_joined": "The potato starch is mixed with plastic (synthetic resin, for example) and then it is given the form of grains of rice. Subsequently, the grains are impregnated with the typical aroma of rice through vaporization. Physicians have insistently alerted the dangers of consuming this artificial product: Three portions could contain both plastic and a small bag of this material. Alarming!-With these simple tricks you can do the test to know if the rice you eat is healthy and free of plastic:-The water test-Put a spoonful of raw rice in a glass of cold water and shake vigorously. If all the rice sinks in the bottom of the glass, then it is healthy. If the grains float on the surface, watch out!-The Fire test-Try to put some rice on the fire with a match or a lighter. If it burns right away and smells like burnt plastic, then you know what to do! (Don't consume it!)-The mortar and pylon test-When you mash some grains of rice into a mortar, the grains are easily reduced to become a fine, white, starch-like powder. But with the artificial rice you will see, on the other hand, how the grains are dyed slightly yellow.-The Mildew test- If you want to be sure that your cooked rice is completely natural, place a small amount inside an airtight container and leave it in a warm place. In a few days you must have mold. Only the imitation rice remains without mold. Here is the test video:-That's how you can keep yourself safe. Show these tricks to all your friends who love rice so no one has to eat a plastic dish at noon!",

            "text_joined": "It is about fifty new cars camouflaged that the Benemérita already has at their disposal, and that in the next weeks they will begin to circulate on highways and Spanish comarcal roads, especially in black points of high accidents.-As confirmed by the Digital Confidential official sources of the Directorate General of Traffic (DGT), these vehicles will replace a part of the current fleet and will not increase the radar.-The model chosen is the Citröen C4 Picasso, of type monovolume, in colors grey and green. The radar sonar will be installed discreetly in a small hole located on the front panel, where the motor's ventilation grille is located. A very difficult area to visualize for the drivers.-These mobile radars are a qualitative leap for traffic, as they are equipped with a new model of chronograph manufactured by the Spanish company Tradesegur, called ' Multiradar C '.-' Invisible ' for Antiradar-The vehicle will hardly catch the eye, but its location is further complicated as this radar model is virtually undetectable for speed control locators, whose use has been widespread among drivers. OBJECT-These devices, which alert with a beep of the proximity of a radar of the DGT, capture the frequencies to which the cinemómetros of the Guardia Civil operate. From the lowest frequencies — the easiest to detect — to higher ones.-However, the new ' Multiradar C ' works at frequency bands much higher than the usual ones. It will be out of the spectrum of 95 percent of the most used locators in Spain. The presence of the waves in the air of this device is much shorter and is therefore virtually undetectable.-This technology is already used in many countries of the European Union but until now it was not present in Spain.-Up to six lanes and low light-The new radar is ready to measure the exact speed of vehicles even in high traffic segments. The circulation of up to six lanes can be monitored with a single device. On the other hand, the photograph, which shows date and time and other information essential for the complaint, is encrypted with a system that prevents any falsification.-These fifty vehicles that traffic circulates now have a flash installed in the area where the car manufacturer usually installs the fog lamps. It automatically fires when a sensor detects difficult light conditions.",

            "text_joined": "Throughout this Thursday, both the actor Jorge Sanz and the wax Museum of Madrid have become a trend in social networks. All this due to a photograph of the actor next to a statue created \"in its image and likeness\" in the Madrid Wax Museum, who has already generated controversy before by the statues of other personalities such as Fernando Alonso or Rafael Nadal, among others.-After this background, users of social networks decided to get their humor and ingenuity to mess with this figure of wax, which has little to do with the actor in Madrid, and the Museum of Wax in Madrid, who received a large number of criticisms of the statue Qu And little or nothing has to do with Sanz. In the image, the actor appears next to a figure with bulging eyes, gray suit and, if not enough, with a somewhat buxom figure. However, on this occasion, nothing is what it seems.-After becoming a trend, the wax Museum of Madrid has had to go to the pass to deny that the figure is his. Although the photo is taken at the Madrid Museum, the image is part, as explained by the Pinacoteca, the props of a special episode of the series ' What was Jorge Sanz? '.-The comedy created by David Trueba, formed from six episodes in 2010 and a special chapter in 2016, is a false documentary that narrates the adventures of the actor from Madrid, who mocks himself throughout the plot. This special chapter, which will be released on March 4 in Movistar +, narrates how it has changed the life of the actor in Madrid humorously.-In one of the scenes, Sanz goes to the wax museum with the aim of revealing his statue, which turns out to be an unwise figure of the artist. The writers have opted, in a clear tone of humour, to produce a figure that has little to do with the actor, responding to the controversial and unwise versions of other personalities that have been presented in the Art gallery in Madrid.-Little has it mattered to social networks that the wax figure was not really a statue of the wax museum in Madrid. Twitter users have redrawn their wits and have carried out hilarious versions of the wax figure, which have compared, among other things, the famous Ecce Homo in the town of Borja.",

The tragic death occurred in a hotel room in the Brazilian city of Natal, according to the Peruvian newspaper ' América TV '.-Some Latin American media have made a pun and have titled ' Drowned In Love ', as the couple was celebrating Valentine's Day. However, the woman was married and at the time of the incident the lover phoned the husband because he was frightened and told him everything that was happening. -\"I cried and yelled on the phone and said, ' run, come here that your wife is dying choking on my semen, '\" he said. The husband thought it was a joke and that could not be possible, but his worst nightmares came true as soon as he arrived at the hotel and received the call from the hospital confirming the death of his wife after choking on the lover's semen.",

            "text_joined": "The Hanukkah, also known as the Festival of the Luminaries, is one of the most joyful festivities of Judaism. It evokes the prodigy that, according to the Hebrew tradition, occurred in the 2nd century before our era when the Macabes, after recovering in combat the Second Temple of Jerusalem, that the Hellenes had desecrated, they realized that there was not enough pure oil to Keep the ritual chandelier on. They found a vase, but it wasn't enough. Miraculously, the flames lit with that scarce oil burned for eight days. To remember it, the Jews ignite at this time the Januquiá, a candlestick of nine arms: one by day of the Miracle, and a ninth central, higher, for the candle with which the others light.-For the past three years, the international Claims Conference, which manages Jewish claims to Germany for Nazi crimes, brings together Holocaust survivors (or Shoah) to celebrate this party. Last Tuesday, third night of Hanukkah, was made in Berlin, Jerusalem, New York, and Moscow. Its drivers want to honor the witnesses who suffered the Holocaust (it is estimated that there could be about 500,000 around the world), and show that they are still present in society, often working as an alert to the anti-Semitism that resurfaces.-\"When we talk about the miracle of Hanukkah, I would like to say that many of you are here today because you survived the Shoah by a miracle,\" said Rüdiger Mahlo, representative of the claims Conference, to 300 survivors gathered at the Jewish community headquarters in Berlin. There was a jovial atmosphere of elderly people, sitting at long tables tasting fried delicacies in oil, typical of Hanukkah. But those same people – who were moved and touched by the kippah, with prom dresses and sequins – suffered 80 years ago from Nazi persecution, watched family and friends die, and lost their heritage.-\"Fewer survivors remain, often very old and poorly health, sometimes because of what they suffered; But many, thank God, are still in a position to report on what happened to them in Nazism, they go to schools, to universities... \", explains in a separate Charlotte Knobloch, of 86 years, president of the Jewish community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, which then ignited the Januquiá with other contemporaries.-She, born in a wealthy Munich family, was a girl in Hitler's time and was saved from the death hidden in the farm of a Catholic family. \"I discovered National Socialism when I was 4 years old, they forbade us to play with non-Jewish children. In 1938, in the Kristallnacht, I was on the street with my father, I saw the synagogue burning, the shops shattered, how the police took the Jews... \"-In 1942, his divorced father managed to send her to the field, to the farm of a former employee of her uncle's home, who made Charlotte pass by her maiden daughter. He lived there until the end of the war. \"My father was in forced labor, but when they were going to deport him, he managed to hide, and he survived,\" he explains. Her grandmother died in 1944 in the Theresienstadt camp.-In the early 1980s, Charlotte Knobloch began working on the care of Holocaust survivors, many of them with atrocious experiences of suffering. \"Even then there were many elderly people alone, they didn't have a family member, and I dedicated myself to that social work, where I have continued,\" he says.-\"It is now a matter of ensuring that the remaining survivors around the world have a comfortable life; I do not say a beautiful life, I say comfortable, \"he continues very earnestly, while in the adjoining hall the celebration of Hanukkah is at its apogee. The claims Conference, founded in 1951, negotiates and distributes compensations to survivors paid by the German government, both direct payments to individuals as well as to geriatric care institutions, food aid, and social programs.-\"I am concerned about the political situation in Germany and Europe, anti-Semitism and hatred of Israel all over the world,\" concludes Charlotte Knobloch. Israel is always for us the refuge to which the persecuted can go. \"",

            "text_joined": "There are dirty rags in every family. Also in one of the few aristocratic lineages of Italy, with a heritage of 1.8 billion euros and an unmatched collection of 623 sculptures Greco, the largest in the world that is in private hands. The treasures of Prince Alessandro Torlonia, dead last year, are these days in the Italian headwaters for a very contested dispute: their four children are at war open for one of the most succulent inheritances that are remembered in the Transalpine country.-So much so, that the Judge Fulvio Vallillo, of the Civil Court of Rome, has arranged the judicial kidnapping of the entire patrimony of the family, the sculptures Greco and another collection of Etruscan art, but also the monumental Palazzo Torlonia, in the Via della Conciliazione (two steps from the Vatican), Villa Albani and Villa Deliza Carolina, in Castel Gandolfo. Everything remains unusable until the patrimony is catalogued and estimated to divide it among the four heirs.-Who has come before the courts is Carlo Torlonia, the firstborn of Prince Alessandro, who denounces that his brothers Paola, Francesca and Giulio took him away from his father in the last years of life to stay with the inheritance.-According to his lawyer, Adriana Boscagli, only after the death of Alessandro Tornolia Carlo discovered \"the letters of the disease, current accounts closed shortly before death, closed boxes and ready to be sent elsewhere.\" He also alleges that the brothers met without telling them and that there were donations to them, including the Palazzo Torlonia, in the terminal phase of the disease.-The will in question is November 2016, a time when, according to the firstborn, \"was unable to contact the father or only by telephone communications, which were filtered by the elder sister or his secretary, who said he was in an optimal State of health. \" Carlo Torlonia assures that he learned from the press of the creation of the Torlonia Foundation, created in 2014 to manage all the art collections. \"Neither I nor my children had any role in it,\" protests the firstborn, who also denounces that his brothers have tried to move sculptures abroad. From what they denounce, they could have wanted to sell the large collection of marbles in an agreement between the foundation, the Paul Getty Museum of Malibu and the government for a recapitalization operation of the Fucino, family owned banking. For the judge, since the goods are of a historical value and there is evidence of the offer, the judicial kidnapping \"is the ideal element to ensure the full conservation of the patrimony\" until a final decision.-In a statement, the other brothers claim that they have never wanted to use any work of art as collateral for the Fucino's banking or recapitalization and ensure that they will appeal the judge's decision. \"There is no risk of dispersal of the artistic patrimony of the Torlonia family because the more than 620 works of art are all catalogued and linked and therefore are not exportable, not even temporarily, without the prior authorization\" of the Ministry of Italian culture, they explain.-According to Claudio Rendera in the great families of Rome, the history of the Torlonia family dates back to a Frenchman, Benedetto Tourlonias from Puy-de-Dôme, father of Marino Torlonia, who moved to Rome in 1750. His son, Giovanni, made his career as an agent of the German banker Fürsterberg and during the French domination of Rome he achieved the favour of the Bonaparte family and the pontifical aristocracy. It became so rich that it bought sumptuous properties and nobility titles. One of his heirs, Leopoldo, became mayor of Rome in the late nineteenth century. It is one of the few Italian aristocratic families who survived the reconstruction of the papal Court in 1969, and still today have the hereditary honor of being princes attending the papal throne. His fame and wealth is so well known that poems have even been written about it. But now everything could be questioned by a family feud. It happens in the best families.",

The complaint is filed against a friend of Valeria. According to the investigation, this boy traveled from Madrid to the province of Segovia accompanied by Valeria. At a certain point, he would have stopped the car in a place located about 65 kilometers from the capital of Segovia, where the rape allegedly would have occurred.-The events took place more than a year ago, as explained to the journalists the government delegate in Castilla y León, Virgina Barcoes, who has added that the police investigation is held in Madrid, where the complaint was filed.-Sources of TSJCyL have explained that the complaint of sexual assault was presented against a young man in Pozuelo de Alarcón (Madrid). Having allegedly taken place in the Sepúlveda judicial party, a question of competition was finally resolved in favour of the Segoviano court. -At present, the procedure is under investigation and, due to the compulsory protection of privacy and the nature of the crime under investigation, the court will not offer any further information, the TSJCyL has indicated.-The instructor of the Court of First instance and instruction that takes the case has ordered the staff's discretion to avoid leaks that precipitate an \"unwanted\" media avalanche, as occurred recently with the case of the woman condemned by Exalting through Facebook the death of the bullfighter Victor Barrio. -However, sources of Diana Quer's family have reported that the news about the alleged sexual assault on Valeria Quer \"does not conform to reality\" and have called for \"respect for her right to privacy.\"-The 18-year-old Diana Quer, older sister of Valeria, disappeared in August 2016 in Puebla do Carmiñal (A Coruña) and her corpse was found on December 31, 2017, murder for which will be judged José Enrique Abuín, alias the chewing gum.-The family spokesman has pointed out that \"once again\" they appeal to the \"ethics and responsibility\" of the media, as they have done in \"countless occasions\" in the case of Diana Quer.",

            "text_joined": "South Korea has successfully approved its first national rocket-manufacturing engine, a fundamental step for the Asian country to complete the development of its first indigenous spacecraft.-The test of this 75-tonne thrust engine was carried out with the launch of a single-phase rocket from the Naro Space Center, about 330 kilometres south of Seoul at 16.00 local time (7.00 GMT), according to the Korea Aerospace Research Institute.  (KARI).-KARI, who broadcast footage of the launch, explained in a statement that the combustion phase of the engine was maintained for 151 seconds, above the target of 140 seconds, and that the projectile reached a peak of 209 kilometers at 319 seconds of being released. The projectile then fell into the sea at a point about 429 kilometres from Jeju Island Korean (south of the country).-The engine, manufactured by KARI, will be used in the first two phases (four will be integrated in each one of them) of the rocket KSLV-II (also known as Nuri), a projectile of three phases currently in phase of development and whose premiere is scheduled for 2021.-South Korea successfully launched in 2013 its first space rocket, the KSLV-I (also called Naro), although the vehicle was not entirely autochthonous as it was the first of the two stages of Russian manufacturing.-South Korea's space program has traditionally been constraineded by its military alliance with the US, which for a long time has hindered the parallel development of ballistic missiles (which employ the same technology).-In case of successfully launching the KSLV-II, South Korea would become part of the exclusive group of countries capable of launching to orbital Heights native-manufactured rockets and integrating the USA, China, Russia, North Korea, Israel, India, Iran, Japan and France.",

The legislative initiative began its handling with the PP in the government. Thus, it leaves directly for publication in the Official Gazette of the State (BOE) and its application.-Data protection will rigorously monitor parties with the new law while announcing resources to the TC.-The controversy of this law has arisen following the article ' 58 bis ' which states that ' the collection of personal data relating to the political views of the people conducting the political parties in the context of their electoral activities will be Protected in the public interest only when adequate guarantees are offered. \"-In addition, the new article indicates that \"political parties, coalitions and electoral groups may use personal data obtained on Web pages and other sources of public access for political activities during the electoral period \".-In this context, together we can – in Comú Podem – at Tide in the Senate has drafted a proposal to amend the opinion of the draft Organic Law on data protection for the article to be withdrawn, but has been rejected by all parliamentary groups.-\"The application of this text that can give the political parties free access to create ideological profiles of the citizens. The current legislation gives the ideological data of the citizen a special protection. However, the new LOPD constitutes a dangerous involution in this regard. It would be very dangerous for the political parties to be free, without prior authorization, to contact the citizens of our country, to make ideological profiles and, in addition, to store them for purposes other than the electoral ones \", has Indicated Senator Celia Cánovas.-For the U.S. Senator we can, the new standard \"can open the door for your political opinions to be recorded and stored.\" \"At a time when far-right groups use the so-called fake news to spread their messages, it is alarming that this law leaves an open channel for information that belongs to the citizenship itself can be used for these Ends, \"he has apostilled.-We can announce that it will resort to TC-Having been approved in the terms, the United States parliamentarian has announced that training will promote its modification through a proposal of organic law and appeal to the Constitutional Court the drafted.-For its part, the socialist Senator Begoña Nasarre has defended that this law \"does not allow the treatment of personal data for the elaboration of profiles based on political opinions\", but, before \"doubts\" that has aroused the controversial article, has been shown In favour of clearing them in the regulatory development and of asking for the corresponding legal reports, as previously proposed by the senator of ERC Miquel Ángel.-Finally, the ' popular ' parliamentarian Maria Rosa Vindel has shown that it is a \"very consensual\" law in Congress, and that it modifies ten other \"very transcendent\" laws. \"It is a good law, ladies and gentlemen, to think about the alarms it causes,\" he stressed.",

Totally within the program, planned and legal. \"-The patrolman of height ' Infanta Elena ' belongs to the Navy, who explained to Europa Press that the ship was conducting a patrol of maritime surveillance at the time of the incident. However, they do not reveal if their commander could be the subject of a file for the diffusion of the hymn by Megaphone.-The video of the patrol car, engraved by a particular one, was diffused this Tuesday through its account of Twitter by the service of information of the Government of Gibraltar. \"Sailing between the little shame and childishness, there we have the ' Infanta Elena ' expressing the glories of Spain in British waters in front of the Levante de Gibraltar,\" said Fabián Picardy executive in the social network.-In addition, a spokesman for the British embassy told Europa Press that, \"as in all the raids,\" the Royal Navy responded to the ship, \"which then abandoned the British territorial waters of Gibraltar.\" As he explained, \"The Royal Navy's responses are made by radio warnings and the control or follow-up of the boat that has made the raid.\"-In view of this situation, he announced that the United Kingdom will present \"a formal diplomatic protest to the Spanish authorities\", as they do whenever \"a raid\" occurs.",

Once the sanction has been confirmed, the people's group is formally calling for the resignation of the minister.-   In the PDeCAT's no-law proposition, collected by Europa Press, it is ensured that the Minister used the insider information he had as Abengoa's advisor to order the sale of a package of shares on behalf of his former wife before the company's value fell. . In his view, this fact shows that Borrell breached the law of the stock market with this operation and this implies \"an example of ethical incompatibility between the exercise of the position of minister\".-   Therefore, and adding that the balance of its management to the forefront of Spanish diplomacy \"is disastrous\", independence training calls Congress to fail Borrell and urge him to resign and, if not, put President Pedro Sanchez to dismiss him.",

            "text_joined": "The Black Friday has been consolidated in recent years as one of the most important dates to take advantage of the discounts. Several studies estimate that the purchases of this day will surpass by 40% those made during any other day of the Christmas period. Two-quarters of shoppers take advantage of this day to purchase products they already have seen, while half advance their holiday purchases.-80% of people who shop on Black Friday are women according to Privalia, and the age range includes 36 to 55 years in the same percentage of users of this ' Black Friday '. The fashion sector will lead the ranking of the most purchased products during this day by the Spanish, representing 90% of the total acquisitions.-Although originally the technology was the first place in terms of the most purchased product, the expansion of the offer to other sectors has relegated the technology to a second position (55%). After these, sports articles (34%), perfumes (25%), household appliances (23%), home decor (20%) and jewellery (15%) complete the classification.-63% of the Spaniards spend between 100 and 300 euros in these products, while 24% disburse a figure between 50 and 100 euros. 55% of the Spaniards will make their purchases through ' online ' platforms. On the other hand, 44% will do so on ' online ' platforms as well as in physical stores and only 1% confirm that you buy only in physical stores. In this sense is interesting to take advantage of the option that offer portals like buykers.com, where it is possible to find the best offers agglutinated in one place as well as Juicy coupons discount.-These coupons to which buykers.com gives us access, allow you to benefit from even greater discounts or get the shipping costs to be free. Among the motivations that lead consumers to buy ' online ', the main one is to take advantage of the big discounts of the products on that day, for the 45%, followed by the time saving that it assumes, in a 42% of the cases, and by the offer that there are of products , for 13% of the users.-As for the device, the mobile (58%) will be the most used by the Spanish, followed by the computer (50%) and the tablet (21%), which implies a change of trend, since the computer (59%) still won the ' smartphone ' (43%) as a device most used in 2017. 44% of the users will carry out their purchases of the Black Friday after leaving the work, while the 40% wait for the night to make their purchases quietly. In addition, 28% expect to make purchases in the morning and only 8% will not be expected the next day and take advantage of the early morning discounts.- To enjoy the benefits of buying this week, the police have warned of possible fraud and has launched several tips to prevent a cheap buy out, in the long run, very expensive. The fundamental thing is to make purchases in safe places to avoid to the maximum extent possible the theft of data of the card, using for it intermediary platforms of payment, double check of the payment and regular check of our checking account in the days Further.",

It is the first installation of a complex that will have in total three parks and that will jointly involve an investment of 2.5 billion.-With a power of 350 MW and an investment of 1.4 billion euros, the Wikinger project, operating since the end of last year, implies the entry of the company into the German electricity market, a country that has converted to the offshore wind in one of its strategic bets . The project has generated around 2,000 jobs in Germany and Spain. -Wikinger becomes the first of the projects ' offshore ' designed and operated 100% by the Spanish group in the Baltic. The inauguration was attended by the general business director of Iberdrola, Francisco Martínez Córcoles, at the port of Sassnitz; The Minister of Energy, Infrastructure and digitization of the state of Mecklenburg-Pomeriana Occidental, Christian Pegel, and the CEO of 50 Hertz, Boris Schucht.-Martínez Córcoles described as \"magnificent\" the work done by the team of employees from 20 countries to make it possible for Wikinger \"to be a reality\". \"It is an example of success of our group of renewables,\" said the executive, who highlighted the development of the project within 18 months.-The sea as a future bet-The offshore wind represents one of the strategic bets of the group, with a significant growth of its projects in recent years and that has led it to have in portfolio the development of 2,500 MW until 2023, with the objective of exceeding a capacity of 3 gigawatts (GW ) with long-term contracts.-The group counts, besides the wind farm of Germany, already with a total of 545 MW of offshore wind in operation thanks to the parks of West of Duddons Sands (United Kingdom), project shared with Orsted of a total of 389 MW-195 MW of Iberdrola- , and this own of Wikinger. Likewise, in the rest of Europe it has work under construction for another 1,700 MW ' offshore ', with the parks of East Anglia 1 (United Kingdom), of 714 MW; Saint BRIEUC (France), of 496 MW, and that of Baltic Eagle (Germany), of 486 MW, whereas in the United States it is partner to 50% in the project Vineyard (Massachusetts), of 800 MW.-Iberdrola has a portfolio of potential projects to which it aspires for another nearly 8,000 MW more in ' offshore ', with the future implementation of another 3,100 MW in Germany and the United Kingdom and about 4,600 MW in the United States, with about 2,200 MW in the Vineyard area and other  2,400 MW in Kitty Hawk (North Carolina).",

            "text_joined": "The boom of the online game is one of the milestones of the 2016. And we are not talking exclusively about sports-related bets, also of course others located in the game world, such is the case of for example online casinos or the much-demanded poker. The unstoppable boom of new technologies in this 21st century is encouraging many to opt to gamble and have fun on the internet rather than go to the usual casinos of life.-This contributes notably to the fact that the number of bettors has not stopped growing these years ago, many of them covered in the generalization of the betting players. That is why the physical casinos do not go through an especially benign situation. The unstoppable future of online gambling has placed them in a somewhat complicated and difficult to confront. This is a challenge that these classic recreational establishments must undertake to re-engage a client that is increasingly happy to play on the net.-Focusing briefly on the particular case of sports betting, today, in our country, football is still the king. One of the reasons why online gaming is acquiring progressively more adepts is the ubiquitous advertising of bookmaker portals consumed in almost any sport-related event.-In the case of the major European football championships, their strength lies in the fact that they are a great showcase for these operators to be able to project themselves on an international scale. The Premier League, our Spanish league and the Calcio (Italy) are the three domestic competitions that more money and gamblers move in this sport king. Of course the portals of the game are aware of this fact. Not in vain, it is in this sport where more types of different offers are proposed to the player. -The traditional 1X2 have been incorporated in the last few different modalities, as which player will open the score, or the total number of goals to be scored in a match, to expose a couple of simple cases of the many that can participate... All these great sporting events, for their constitution and development, favor live betting. -During the first six months of this year, they moved a figure of 1.821 billion euros, which is 30% more than the previous period. This amount represents 70% of the total monetary amount generated by the sports betting in the first semester that vertebrae the year. It is one of the many hopeful data that the reports on this sector are raising. ",

With his removal, we begin a new chapter in our history in which we learn from past mistakes so that we are no longer condemned to repeat them, \"he said in statements collected by the NBC network.-For city Councillor Mitch O'Farrell, the removal of the statue is a \"natural step in the advances to eliminate the false narrative that Columbus discovered America.\" \"In addition, Columbus himself was responsible for genocide and his actions contributed to the greatest genocide ever recorded. His image is not to be held anywhere, \"added O'Farrell, a member of the Wyandot Nation of American Indians.-There is no official protest from Spain, a country that also has attacks on the figure of Columbus from the independence or from can and the most radical left, usually critical of the figure of the Discoverer and the great feat of 1492 that led to America the Civilization, the law and the University.-Italian protests-Councilman Joe Buscaino, of Italian descent, expressed reservations about the cancellation of Columbus Day and tried to make an unsuccessful effort to get the motion withdrawn. \"With or without Columbus, the Italians will continue to celebrate their sacrifices and contributions to this great country and our great city,\" said Buscaino.-The surprising thing about this decision is that it seems more typical of other countries such as Chávez Venezuela which, in 2004, consented to the violent demolition of the statue of Columbus that presided over the Plaza de Caracas, among enfervorizados cries of the followers of the regime.",

            "text_joined": "\n\n \nThe excess plastic bags has been a problem for years, especially in oceans and seas, where, since the years 70 of the twentieth century, tons of plastic are falling that takes decades to biodegrade, contaminating the water with its materials and killing AV It is and marine mammals.\n\nBut the solution could be 23 kilometers from the coast of the North Sea, where a Dutch company has deployed a prototypical system, created by a young man of only 19 years, buoy Slat, floating barriers that could stop all those bags, that concentrated plastic , and, by means of an anchorage system, prevent the garbage from moving, in order to suck it and remove it from the water. The idea is to send the plastic, once picked up, to a recycling company.\nRevolutionary system The difference between this system and others that have been previously tested is that, at other times, the method was to try to fish the plastic from a ship, ways that were criticized for being also polluting, expensive and inefficient, because it It figures it would take almost 80,000 years to clean up the entire ocean. The floating barriers also have cons, among which are found that they can only recover the garbage from the surface, which represents a small percentage of the total.\n\nHowever, if its usefulness is determined, the system could be fully deployed in 2020, and it is estimated that in a decade it could collect almost half of the plastic of the so-called great garbage stain of the Pacific.\nIn Morocco or bags will be manufactured in the meantime, countries put dissuasive measures of the use of plastic bags. Among the most recent, that of Morocco, which from today, 1 July, prohibits the manufacture, import, export, commercialization and use of plastic bags. Marrakech will host the COP22 climate summit and the Moroccan Government has promoted a \"zero bag\" campaign, where several celebrities pose with wicker baskets and cloth bags.\n\nHttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IjaZ2g-21E\n",

            "text_joined": "\n\nThe price of Bitcoin is rising again, as a clear indicator that Criptomoneda enjoys better health than ever. We can say that the health of Bitcoin is at a good time, as it has been able to recover smoothly from the ups and downs it had suffered during 2017. We have to bear in mind that during the 2017 the Bitcoin reached a really spectacular price, in the month of December it reached a price close to the 20,000 USD, and nevertheless in January 2017 the price was only close to the 1000 USD. This vertiginous evolution that the Bitcoin suffered during 2017, managed to propitiate some destabilization in the Criptomoneda, which today has already managed to get rid of, thanks to a sensible evolution that today places its valuation close to the 8200 USD. \n            if (window. innerWidth < = 650) {document. write (\"< div id = ' DFP-Steal-1 ' class = ' banner banner-R ' data-banner = ' Steal-1 ' data-size = ' mobile ' > <script> googletag. cmd. push (function () {Googletag. Display (' DFP-steal-1 ');}); </\" + \"script></div>\");\n                            } If you want to find out more about the Bitcoin world, you should review an introduction to the Bitcoin in order to have clear information about how the world of Criptomonedas works in general and the bitcoin in particular. We have to take into account that even though today the world of the Criptomonedas has evolved a lot, and there are many Criptomonedas, with Bitcoin started everything, and that is why it is important to try to understand what happens with the original Criptomoneda. It is important to note that it is not necessary to have technical knowledge to understand what the Criptomonedas are and how the Bitcoin works.\nWhat happened to the Bitcoin?\nThe Bitcoin has hoarded unprecedented popularity in recent years, mainly due to the impressive rise in its valuation during the year 2017. As previously discussed, and to put in context, on January 1, 2017, the Bitcoin price was close to 1000 USD, however, at the end of the year, in December 2017, the price was around 20,000 USD, a spectacular rise for just a Period of one year. It is impossible to compare this impressive rise in the Bitcoin with any other type of financial asset.\nWhat happened was that the Bitcoin went down to lows close to 5800 USD last June, and yet today it is recovering by reaching approximately 8200 USD. Although it may seem that there is a very exaggerated fluctuation, the truth is that during this year Bitcoin is keeping quite stable, without growths as pronounced as those that were experienced in 2017, and that began to be really impressive to From November 2017. \n            if (window. innerWidth < = 650) {document. write (\"< div id = ' DFP-Steal-2 ' class = ' banner banner-R ' data-banner = ' Steal-2 ' data-size = ' mobile ' > <script> googletag. cmd. push (function () {Googletag. Display (' DFP-steal-2 ');}); </\" + \"script></div>\");\n                            } The bitcoin is in good health despite these impressive price fluctuations, Bitcoin is in great health. Many self-proclaimed finance gurus had predicted that this was the end of Bitcoin, and nothing farther from reality. More and more people are betting on making transactions with Bitcoin, or using Bitcoin as an investment tool. While it is true that it has high volatility, it is also true that all financial assets have a high volatility. Bitcoin is something new, which is logically exposed to aggressive speculative behaviors, such as those that it suffered during 2017, but of which it has certainly come out gracefully and ready to offer the best version of itself to the market.\n\n",

So it is clear that there must be a substantial correction of the fiscal trajectory, not a marginal one, \"the Latvian expressed at a press conference, asking for the latest intentions of Rome to reduce a few tenths the deficit target for next year of 2.4%. \n            if (window. innerWidth < = 650) {document. write (\"< div id = ' DFP-Steal-1 ' class = ' banner banner-R ' data-banner = ' Steal-1 ' data-size = ' mobile ' > <script> googletag. cmd. push (function () {Googletag.

The Vice-President of the Community executive has pointed out that the difficulties of some Italian banks to issue bonds are a \"consequence\" of the \"market turbulence\" that has led to the budget draft prepared by the Government of movement 5 Stars and the league.\nLatvian has emphasized that interest rates on public debt emissions have increased by 1% to 1.5%, depending on the maturity years, with respect to a year ago, and that this factor is already reaching the real economy through higher costs of  Financing of businesses and households. This has led to a slowdown in the Italian economy, he said, and then remember that the European Commission revised downward its growth forecast for Italy this year, from 1.3% to 1.1%.\n\"This seems to indicate that it is necessary for the Italian Government to correct its course with regard to its fiscal and macroeconomic policy, since the current management seems to be counterproductive,\" he warned. \n            if (window. innerWidth < = 650) {document. write (\"< div id = ' DFP-Steal-2 ' class = ' banner banner-R ' data-banner = ' Steal-2 ' data-size = ' mobile ' > <script> googletag. cmd. push (function () {Googletag.

The protesters believe that the government has made a deaf ear to its petitions and also calls for a meeting with Macron.-More than 143,000 users in the social networks have already been \"interested\" by the event that cites the \"yellow waistcoats\" in the Place de la Concordia in Paris between eight and eleven in the morning, to march towards the Elysium.-\"You have to give the shot of grace and go all to Paris by all possible means (share car, train bus, etc...)\", indicated the message in the social network, through which the blockades were organized on November 17.-The spokesman for the executive, Benjamin Griveaux, has reiterated that he will not reverse the fuel taxation and resumed the words of the Prime Minister, Édouard Philippe, who yesterday said \"have heard\" popular discontent.-\"They ask to be able to live decently from their work, that their children live better than them, that is why we prefer to put taxes on the fuel and not on the job and we have launched devices to accompany them because the ecological transition is difficult,\" said Griveaux.-The spokesman said that France must be removed from the current oil model because \"if in 18 months the producer countries\" decide to increase the price of the barrel this will have a direct impact on the \"pocket of the French\".",

He adds, however, that Labour opposition may attempt to force a motion of censure against May, or propose a second referendum, before adhering to that eventual motion with the Conservatives.",

Frankly, I don't know. Let us give the European Parliament the opportunity to see if it is able to find a common denominator between countries that are in such different geographical situations, \"he said in a meeting with the media during the meeting of Foreign Ministers that is concluded in Vienna . -Borrell insisted that this is a proposal that has to be discussed in the European Parliament where \"all countries will have to explain their point of view and to what extent that favors or not the processes of reconciliation of family life, adaptation of schedules to Hor Light and energy consumption. \" -The CEOE, in favor of the suppression of the timetable changes-In statements to EFE, the director of industrial relations of the CEOE, Jordi García Viña, believes that the decision of the European Commission to put an end to the change to winter time in the European Union will be beneficial and not harm the companies. -In this sense, it has considered that collective bargaining already resolves the schedules of different sectors, be it trade or the hotel industry and believes that in the tourist activity, which could be the most affected by the hours of sun, also would be regulated via agreements. -The transition from summer to winter is produced each year on the last weekend of October and is supposed to delay clocks in all EU countries for one hour. García Viña has pointed out that the elimination of time changes will certainly benefit some European countries more than others but has pointed out that there is also no big time difference within the EU.  -Changing twice a year the time also has social repercussions, which can be noticed during some days at work and in companies, he pointed out. Also, on the rationalization of schedules, the employer has already said that it shares the initiatives that pursue the reconciliation of family and work life, but considers that it is a concept that goes beyond the closing times.-For many sectors, companies and branches of activity, a uniform timetable would be detrimental to the needs of workers, consumers, entrepreneurs and society and would affect the competitiveness of companies, he says.",

            "text_joined": "Farewell to Hugs, kisses, gifts, endless Selfis, road miles, tastings of typical products... The campaign for the Andalusian elections next Sunday, December 2, which will give way to the XI Legislature, has come this Friday night to an end with all parties appealing to a massive mobilization to achieve continuity or change after 36 years of Socialist government. With a PSOE to which all the polls predicts winner of the elections, the margin that obtains on its immediate competitor can be decisive to continue or not to govern to a potential sum of PP, Cs and even Vox, that some see possible. The uncertainty is in a fork of 4-5 seats that could tilt the balance in one direction or another, with its consequences in a national key reading.-The campaign began with a low pulse by the PSOE, who all the polls already gave as a winner and aspired to look at his right (Cs) and left (forward Andalusia) in what Susana Diaz defined as \"broadband government.\" He visited more villages than any other candidate, kissed more ladies than anyone, but the tone of his speech was far from the emotional connection of other occasions; A strategy, say their own, to get out of the tension that brought other formations.-In front of it were the parties of the \"blockade\", as the Socialist president and candidate for the re-election called it: Forward Andalusia, coalition to which it hardly mentioned and which defended that for the first time there was an alternative of change to the left of the PSOE, and the Block on the right, more concerned about his own fight for a second since he would guarantee or settle his role on the national stage for the future. In fact, both PP and Cs counted on the prominence of their top leaders, Pablo Casado and Albert Rivera, who did not hesitate to raise the Andalusian appointment as a first round of the general election and ended up polluting the regional debate with the management of Catalan theme, as appreciated in the two debates to four televised.-But the fragmentation of the conservative bloc has not only made the message more to the right, to the chagrin of the regional leaders of the PP, but it has given rise to the emergence of a new actor, Vox, who even the pre-electoral survey of the CIS opened its entry into the P Regional Arlamento. The popular have recognized that there are some of their disgruntled voters, who previously only escaped Cs, and have not hesitated to wink or recognize without ambages that, if they achieve parliamentary representation, will count on them to evict the PSOE and get The long-awaited change after 36 years.-Adelante Andalucía is confident that the fragmentation of the right is such that it will end up penalizing these parties when adding the seats that come to the parties with the system of remains. The beneficiaries, they assure, will be them, but also the PSOE, as yesterday conceded the married one. \"For a few tenths of a vote, the last seats granted in each province can give a change or continuity,\" he insisted, appealing to the useful vote to his party not to lose those remains.-In the socialist ranks, the alarms have been turned on, because less than 42 seats would complicate matters to Diaz; That is why it was the candidate who in recent days has been responsible for shaking the ghost of a government \"xenophobic and sexist\" with Vox, and not stop seeking a massive mobilization. His fear is that the less-excited socialist voter ends up staying at home because he knows his team will win. Hence his calls to militancy to go door to door to \"win, but win well.\" Moreover, after a few moments reluctant to pollute the Andalusian discourse, it has ended up recognizing that its victory in Andalusia will serve as a \"dike of containment on the right\" and facilitate the PSOE win \"with a larger majority\" in the generals and therefore continue Ruling. However, many among the Socialists do not hide that to bring to mind Vox could be a play of \"risk\" by encouraging the vote ultraconservative, making the rights to add and prevent the PSOE to reach the four decades in front of the Junta de Andalucía.",

            "text_joined": "King Juan Carlos will come on Thursday, Day 6, to the Congress, where the Solemn act for the 40 anniversary of the Constitution is to be held. The detail was known this Friday at noon, when the Zarzuela made public the agenda of the week. The head of state, however, did not want to inform where the former monarch will be placed in the parliamentary scenography. Felipe and Letizia will preside over a ceremony attended by Queen Sofia, senators, former presidents and speakers of the Fundamental law. The current head of State shall make a speech, like the President of Congress, Ana Pastor. Juan Carlos will not, at least within the Hemicycle, added Fuentes de la Zarzuela.-Among the different places that can occupy in the lower house is included the guest tribune; The centre of the Hemicycle, where the stenographers are usually placed, and the Presidency, together with the Kings. Parliamentary sources clarified that the decision will be taken by Zarzuela even if the Congress give more information from Monday. A punctualization to anticipate possible problems, like the one that lived the two institutions last year, when Juan Carlos did not participate in the celebration of the first democratic elections also in the Congress. The old monarch made his anger known and the House of the king was accused of that absence. -Now, before the main week of the constitutional celebrations, the Zarzuela has decided to compensate that episode and Juan Carlos, in addition to going to the Congress, will also participate in the audience to the Advisory Council of the Monday Cortes General and at the inauguration of ' Democracy 1978-2018 ' at the CaixaForum, on Tuesday.-Juan Carlos ' attendance at the Congress Act was unclear. Some episodes have complicated what should have been the natural fit of the King Emeritus in the memory of that historical stage, in which he played a key role. The head of the state takes five months off the official agenda due to health problems and also to recordings in which his exfriend Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein said, among other things, that the monarch Emeritus had obtained a commission by the bird to Mecca. The national hearing considered the signs \"extremely weak\" and closed the case. -To the controversy over this shelve was added another controversy last week, when the former head of state appeared in the GP of Formula 1 of Abu Dhabi, where he greeted the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohamed bin Salman, to which the CIA considers the instigator of the murder of the journalist Jamal Jashoggi. The Zarzuela highlighted that it was a private agenda.",

            "text_joined": "The government of Pedro Sánchez will approve this Friday in the Council of Ministers one of its main measures to try to alleviate the precarious work between one of the groups most punished after the outbreak of the economic crisis: the young people. It was anticipated by Secretary of State for employment, Yolanda Valdeolivas, on Tuesday and confirmed by the president himself in a television interview on Wednesday. \"We have a clear roadmap and a clear social agenda. We are going to launch this same Friday with the youth employment plan. \"-This Plan of shock for the young employment 2019-2021 aims to combat the high figures of unemployment that still drags this group includes measures such as the hiring of 3,000 technicians for the labour insertion, the drafting of a statute for the non-working practices or A plan to repatriate that talent that he saw after the outbreak of the crisis that his future was abroad.-All these measures, collected in a document to which the newspaper has been accessed, will be financed with an amount of 2 billion euros for the next three years and have as main objective to reduce youth unemployment by about 10 points. The plan comes after discussing it at the Social dialogue tables with employers and unions. Despite the initial reluctance, entrepreneurs have ended up seconding the measure.-According to the latest data available from the 2018 third quarter active Population survey, the unemployment rate was up to three times higher among the youngest than the average unemployed. Discouragement, lack of opportunity or precariousness has also caused activity rates, i.e. availability and willingness to work, to have fallen by 10 years to 15 points.-The number of new technicians that the central government will finance in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities coincides with the cuts after the entry to the government of former president Mariano Rajoy and has been claimed by both the PSOE in opposition and the Unions. \"It is a first step, although to reach the ratios between the occupyer and user of the European average would be necessary 7,000 new technicians,\" says a trade union source.-The idea is that these counsellors enter into contracts for work and services of year and a half, without the written commitment of the government, according to sources present at the tables of Social dialogue, that later become a fixed template.-The idea of this measure is that the figure commonly known as \"scholar\" does not end up camouflaging a more working relationship than learning and stop hiring among the youngest. In this sense, sources consulted blame a lack of concretion in the plan.-This reform, partly inspired by the French model, will eliminate all those bonuses to training contracts. Something that also comes with the reduction of total unemployment up to a figure of about 15%. At the time, the government of the PP justified these bonuses due to high unemployment rates and, at a time of expansion of employment, the executive of Pedro Sanchez has decided to eliminate them.-According to data from the state Public Employment Service (SEPE) collected by CCOO in early 2018, in Spain there were one million university students in external practices, as well as 282,000 vocational training students, 63,000 unemployed people in Training for employment and 100,000 persons in the other three modalities of non-labour practices.-To ensure that none of these practices engage in fraud, the Ministry of Labour studies to extend the resources for inspection and enable inspectors to make extra hours focused on prosecution. A practice already used against temporary and partial unjustified hiring.-Another axis is to facilitate the return of young people migrated after the crisis. The instruments will be aid to the re-incorporation to the labor market, via subsidies to the self-employment or incentives for the companies when hiring. Also to pay back, as rent aid. ",

            "text_joined": "An Australian judge has acquitted the exarchbishop of Adelaide, Philip Wilson, by accepting his appeal against a one-year house arrest sentence that was imposed on him for covering up a case of paedophilia.-Wilson, aged 68, was found guilty in May of covering up, during a police investigation between 2004 and 2006, the sexual abuses committed by priest James Fletcher against two of his altar servers in the decade of 1970.-Judge Roy Ellis of the District Court of Newcastle, in the state of New South Wales, revoked the sentence imposed by a lower instance, as confirmed to Efe judicial sources of this state.-The magistrate considered that the prosecution could not prove beyond reasonable doubts the guilt of the preside, which he described as an honest and consistent witness.-\"There is no adequate basis in which I can trust to reject the recurring evidence,\" the judge said according to the ABC chain.-Wilson, the highest office in the Catholic Church convicted of paedophilia-related offenses in Australia, claimed during the trial that he did not recall the victim's complaint.-Fletcher was convicted of abuses in 2004 and died in prison two years later.-The prosecutor's office, which had also filed an appeal for Wilson to enter prison, declined to clarify Efe will appeal the opinion. -An official commission investigating the response of Australian institutions to cases of paedophilia revealed that the Catholic Church, with strong roots in the country, received complaints of 4,500 people for alleged abuses of some 1,880 religious and priests among 1980 and 2015.-Pope Francis accepted last July 30th the resignation of Wilson as Archbishop of Adelaide.",

            "text_joined": "The number of specimens of northern Bettong, known in Australia as the \"Kangaroo rat\", does not exceed 2,500 copies and if not taken measures could disappear in 10 years, alerted on Wednesday the Global Fund for Nature (WWF).-\"We must protect the bettong that remain and restore forests, controlling pests and using recommended fire control plans to maintain and expand their habitat,\" said Tim Cronin, an Australian subsidiary of the Organization at A statement.-The Bettong of the North (Bettongia Tropica), a marsupial of the size of a hare that moves slowly jumping and which became endemic throughout Australia, currently occupies an area of 145 square kilometers in two places of the humid tropics of the state of Queensland, in northeastern Australia.-\"But it is known that only one of the populations is stable,\" said the report of the North Bettong Project published after an investigation that lasted five years.-According to the study, the Bettong of the north, whose population extended in an area of 1,000 square kilometres at the beginning of the European colonization of Australia, has an \"important and irreplaceable role in the ecosystem\".-The absence of the Northern Bettong would imply a reduction in the diversity of truffles and possibly damage to the diversity of the trees and the ecosystem in general, said this project in which also participated James Cook University, the traditional owners And authorities in Queensland and Australia.-It is estimated that the habitat of these marsupials was reduced to 355 square kilometers in the last three decades and that only the area called Lamb Range, southwest of the city of Cairns, seems to retain a relatively strong population.-\"The good news is that the tropical bettong is stable at the core of its habitat,\" said Sandra Abell, who managed the scientific project, whose projections suggest that the Lamb range population could disappear in 10 years if no measures are taken.-Abell warned that \"the current number, which probably does not exceed 2,500 (copies) is well below the 5,000-1000 specimens that was calculated when it was given the status of ' in jeopardy ' on the IUCN Red List (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) \".-One of the threats of the northern Bettong are the wild cats, one of their predators that was detected in 40 percent of the eleven areas analyzed, as well as livestock and wild pigs, competitors for food and that alter the habitat and availability of AL Imentos.-This is compounded by the impact of the reduction of indigenous fire-control regimes that help maintain forest health.-\"To make matters worse, climate change is likely to alter its habitat more by affecting the availability of seasonal food and exacerbating the threats of wildfires and wild predators,\" WWF said in the communiqué.

            "text_joined": "Vice, a biographical film about former American vice President Dick Cheney starring Christian Bale, and a star is born to lead the singing voice at the Golden Globe Gala next January 7 in Los Angeles. The first, written and directed by Adam McKay, will come as the most charged of the night with six nominations, with the debut as director of Bradley Cooper at a short distance, with five mentions. It smells like it could be an unforgettable night for the actor from Philadelphia and his co-worker, Lady Gaga. Both opt for Best Actor and actress award in drama category. -Also with five nominations will be presented the Favourite, starring Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, and Green Book, the story of jazz pianist Don Shirley. From behind, with four, the proposal of Spike Lee, BlacKkKlansman, and the return of Mary Poppins. Its protagonists, Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda, will opt for a prize for their work in individual category. -The gala will have a Spanish presence of two regulars in these conflicts, Antonio Banderas and Penelope Cruz, both nominated for their work on television. Malaga will compete in the category of best limited-series actor or TV movie by Genius: Picasso, while Cruz is the best actress in the role of a television series for the murder of Gianni Versace. For both of them it's his fourth nomination.-A Priori, Bradley Cooper, also nominated as Best Director for his debut, will share prominence with the Mexican of the moment in Hollywood, Alfonso Cuarón. His painful vision of childhood, Rome, received three nominations, including the best director and best screenplay. It is also the great favorite to get the Golden Globe for Best Foreign film, a category that will compete with Capernaum, Girl, never Look awayy Shoplifters, and not be Cold War, the Polish Pawel Pawlikowski. -The one that has passed the cutting in an imposing way is Black Panther. In the year in which it was floated to introduce in the Oscars a category for the most popular tapes, the second most blockbuster title of the year got into the category of best drama film. He will play his tricks with a born star, the blues of Beale StreetBlacKkKlansman, and Bohemian Rhapsody. -The contest of the Golden Globe for best comedy will be between Vicey the return of Mary Poppins, with Crazy Rich Asians, the favorite and Green Book completing the poster. -As for the Best Actress award for Drama, the bets are tilted by Lady Gaga, who will see them with Glenn Close, Nicole Kidman, Melissa McCarthy and Rosamund Pike. In the actors ' chapter, Cooper is the most visible option in front of Willem Dafoe, Lucas Hedges, Rami Malek and John David Washington.-Interesting it seems the dispute in the category of Best animated film. The extraordinary work of Wes Anderson, Isle of Dogs, will be seen with one of the sensations of the season, Ralph breaks the Internet, of Rich Moore and Phil Johnston.",

            "text_joined": "Movistar raises prices in some of its rates; Inevitably, in all of them that add Netflix, which is integrated into Telefonica's television platform since next week, but also in other high-package modalities. Thus, old modalities of the merger category are expensive. Telefónica, of course, offers alternatives: complete services, improve catalogs. In short, move on to the company's new options launched in October. Who has football, is offered series... and vice versa. The company tries to monetize its trade agreements by encouraging its most complete convergent offers. On the one hand, it needs to put in value the disbursement made by sporting rights; From this Monday, to accommodate your agreement to integrate Netflix. -That television service will be available from next week and will be released on the 10th, in a media presentation. According to sources in this journal, it has worked with an integration in different levels of usability, with an interface on demand similar to the one that Netflix has established with Comcast in the USA and with Sky in the United Kingdom. If a user queries Movistar, it would have before Netflix, integrated the contents of this as part of the options available, both in a carousel and searches. It should not be forgotten that both Vodafone and Orange already gave place to Netflix, before Telefónica, on their respective television platforms.-Netflix rates are already known, even if they have not been reported yet. Telefónica uploaded them to the internet and were captured on different websites, such as Engadget. The resulting new packages are these:-The version for two simultaneous accounts. It is achieved with an increase of 10 euros at the price of Movistar fusion selection or Movistar Total merger (the latter would go up to 140 euros with Netflix). If the client has Total merge Plus, adding Netflix has a cost of $5 USD per month (los165). However, in these cases would be saved with respect to any parallel recruitment of Movistar and Netflix, as the options of this platform are the basic 8 euros, the standard 11 and premium 14. -The version for four simultaneous accounts on Netflix. The recruitment would increase by 13 euros The merger payments selection or by Total merger-this would grow to 143-. In the case of Total Fusion Plus, add 8 euros and the maximum is reached, the amount of 168 euros per month. -Apart from this agreement with the main World Service of streaming, Telefónica raises the price of the old high-end packages, with the door open to hire alternatives such as those that were launched last October. As of February 5, there is an increase of 5 euros that practically pushes the category jump.-Fusion + Total Football and fusion + total leisure. It increases from 125 to 130 euros. Therefore, a customer of this option could go through the same price from 130 to Total merger. If it was part of the base of clients of football, it would win Movistar Series and Movistar premieres, while it would get all the football if it was framed within the users of leisure. -Fusion + Premium. There is an increase of 5 euros, from 150 to 155 if you have two mobile lines and 175 to 180 if you have four. -It is noteworthy that Telefónica has recently uploaded prices on mobile, internet and fixed. It has come to the converged offers, although some prices are maintained:-Fusion # 0. The price is maintained and is invited to access the new portfolio, which has the merger mode 0, with the channel #Vamos and a lower price (55 euros versus 60)-Fusion Series. Nor is it increased and it is sought that the user enters in the football, by which Telefónica has made a strong disbursement: Fusion Base includes Movistar Partidazo, league and #Vamos for a price of 72 euros, by the 77 of fusion Series.-Fusion + Football and Fusion + leisure. They experience a rise of 5 euros. In this case we want to mobilize the client to merge selection, winning Series if he was a football client, and one of the two soccer options (the whole league or champions more Europa league) if he was a leisure client. There is no change in the invoice, which stagnates at 95 euros.",

            "text_joined": "The government of Pedro Sánchez continues to maintain a discourse which, according to the multiple warnings of national and international bodies, does not reflect the real situation of the Spanish economy. The Minister of Economy, Nadia Calviño, again defended yesterday that Spain will meet the deficit targets and that the slowdown is less important than the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the European Commission estimates, did not hesitate to say that the salary Minimum Interprofessional (SMI) will not destroy jobs and even anticipated that there are good news in terms of debt because it will reduce up to 97% of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of this exercise. -At the informative breakfast organized by Europa Press, the minister said that the economy is \"absolutely online to meet the deficit target of 2.7%\", and that if the government manages to pass the budgets the deviation in 2019 will be 1.8%. This would mean a nine-tenth reduction that neither the IMF nor the Commission believes possible, and Brussels has already warned that the executive's plan \"presents risks of non-compliance with the Stability Pact.\" But Calviño ignored all the warnings and just stressed that the OECD does consider the reduction feasible. -In terms of growth, the head of economy underlined the robust behavior of GDP, and converted the widespread decline that a few weeks ago the IMF, Brussels and the OECD itself carried out in a mere link to official forecasts. And as for the impact of the SMI, Calviño explained that the rise of the minimum wage to 900 euros agreed by the government and we can not have any negative consequence, something that not only contradicts what was pointed out by the independent authority of Fiscal responsibility ( AIReF) or the Bank of Spain, but what only one day before the Secretary of State of Social Security said. -Octavio Granat, who is one of the biggest connoisseurs of the labor market and the pension system within the government, acknowledged on Tuesday that there is indeed a risk that the rise of 22% of the SMI destroy jobs. \"This may exist and there is no point in denying it,\" he said. But Calviño, as with organisms, also rejected the pomegranates thesis and maintained that the estimate of economics is that \"the package will have a neutral impact on growth and employment.\"-Calviño's refusals even extended to his own future as he ruled out that his intention was to return to Brussels. Starting next summer, the European Commission must begin its renewal process, and both Community sources and the Government itself point out that Calviño's desire is to hold a relevant position in Europe and that it is also one of the most prepared figures in the Sanchez's executive to do it. But Calviño, unable to contain a smile that made him understand that he could think otherwise, said he is centered in the ministry to \"130%\" and has no time to \"think about something else.\"",

            "text_joined": "The British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) today announced that it has initiated legal action against Ryanair for failing to compensate passengers affected by flight cancellations during strikes by their cabin staff workers (TCP) Last summer. - In a statement, the CAA notes that strikes are not \"extraordinary circumstances\" and are not exempt from the application of European EC 261/2004, whereby passengers affected by delays or cancellations are entitled to receive accommodation In a hotel as well as transportation to and from the airport. - According to European regulations, if it is necessary to stay in an airport for a cancellation or for a delay of more than three hours, passengers have the right to receive compensation of up to 600 euros. - Ryanair alleges that the interruption of flights resulting from an industrial strike by its flight personnel is an \"extraordinary circumstance\" so that, in its understanding, it will not be obliged to pay compensations. - Ryanair passengers affected in the United Kingdom have filed several compensation claims directly to the airline, which have been rejected, so some of them decided to send their complaints to AviationADR, an agency authorized by the Authority of Civil Aviation, to provide an alternative dispute resolution for passengers ' complaints. - Ryanair has informed the British Aeronautical Authority that it has terminated its agreement with AviationADR. From the CAA, they explain that passengers who submitted a strike-related compensation claim through AviationADR will now have to wait for the outcome of the aviation Authority's resolution. - For those with new claims that are not satisfied with the outcome or who have not received a response from the airline within eight weeks, they should contact the Civil Aviation Authority's advisory and complaint team (PACT).",

            "text_joined": "Canadian researchers have discovered in a remote valley of the province of British Columbia, in the west of the country, a gigantic cave of at least 135 meters of depth, of which there was no news until now.-The entrance to the cavern, which has been provisionally baptized as Sarlacc's pit (the Pit of SARLACC), was discovered last April by a helicopter of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change of the Canadian province, which was conducting a census Of caribou in the region. The cave is specifically located in the northeast of the Wells Gray Provincial Park.-The geologist Catherine Hickson, in front of a team that made an expedition to the cave last September, said the discovery \"opens a new chapter\" in the History of Canadian speleology. \"It is absolutely astonishing,\" he said, in statements collected by the agency the Canadian Press. One of the team members, Lee Hollis, was the one who descended the entrance of the cave, reaching down about 80 meters.-The entrance to the cave is about 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. The total depth is calculated at least 135 meters, but it is difficult to determine accurately due to the mist and vapor caused by a waterfall.-Hickson explained, in statements collected by local media, that the cave has the approximate size of a football field: \"Think of a football field, and put it at one end of the cave down,\" he said: \"It's like a gigantic oval hole that descends and Descends. \"-The provisional name of Sarlacc's Pit is due to its alleged similarity to the lair of Sarlacc, a creature from the return of the Jedi movie, from the Star Wars saga. The cave will receive an official name after consulting it with the first (aboriginal) nations of the region.-Although the cave is located in a remote area covered in ice and snow most of the year, the authorities secretly keep their exact location to preserve the unique characteristics of the area.-It is believed that the cave was formed under glacial structures over tens of thousands of years. The reduction of glaciers as a result of climate change and, in particular, the thawing of a nearby glacier, could be the reason why the entrance has now been outdoors, said Hickson.",

            "text_joined": "The European Commission no longer complies with the grand statements made by digital magnates like Zuckerberg about their fight against disinformation campaigns. As of January 1, and at least until the elections to the European Parliament are held in May 2019, the large Internet platforms must report to Brussels on a monthly basis on the outcome of their combat against fake news and, in particular , on closed false accounts, crawling bots (messages propagated automatically without human interaction) or how they collaborate with external data and content verifiers.-Among the companies required to report are Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter, which last October signed with the EU a voluntary code of conduct in which they pledged to redouble efforts against fake news. The Code provides for an annual review. But Brussels has decided to narrow the siege after witnessing the imminent risk that digital hoaxes will multiply in the coming months.-The detailed monthly verification is part of the action Plan against disinformation approved on Wednesday by the European Commission, whose primary objective is to shield the more than 50 elections planned in the EU countries over the next 24 months, Including the European elections. In Spain, in addition to the elections to the European Parliament, regional elections will be held on 26 May in 13 communities and municipalities throughout the country.-The Commission's plan considers that the disinformation campaigns against the Community institutions and against the EU in general will \"increase in all likelihood in the final stretch towards the elections of May 2019\". And it goes without telling that the target of the attackers is no other than to discredit the institutions and their representatives and \"undermine the European project itself\".-The document describes the fake news as one of the weapons of the hybrid war in which several foreign powers have embarked. And openly accuses Russia of being one of the main aggressors.-\"There is a lot of evidence pointing to Russia as one of the main sources of disinformation in Europe,\" said the vice-president of the Digital Area Commission, Andrus Ansip, during the presentation of the Plan in Brussels. \"Misinformation is part of Russia's military doctrine and its strategy is to weaken and divide the West,\" added Ansip.-The EU realized the Russian threat from 2014, during the Moscow-Ukraine conflict. The commission created a \"strategic communication\" unit dedicated to detecting and countering disinformation campaigns. Despite its scarce means (just over a dozen people), the unit has identified more than 4,500 examples of digital Infundios propagated from Russia since 2015.-The digital flood of falsehoods, according to Brussels, has arreciado above all, around electoral appointments within the EU or during times of tension with Moscow, like the Syrian war, the demolition of a commercial plane in Ukrainian airspace (with dozens of dead , many of them Europeans) or following the recent chemical attack in the United Kingdom (attributed to the Kremlin).-The new Plan envisages hiring 11 more people before the May elections and half a hundred people in two years, among data analysts, multi-lingual researchers and communication experts. The draft European budgets for 2019 also envisages doubling the budget of the Strategic Information Unit, which will go from 1.8 billion in 2018 to 5 billion next year.",

            "text_joined": "It is not common in Cuba for public announcements of official measures that repeal other adopted by Decree-Law in the opposite direction, more when those go on the socialist line to use and are recent, but that is precisely what has just happened in Havana. In an unexpected twist, the government of the new Cuban president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, amended a set of rules that restricted private initiative and increased controls on the exercise of self-employment, regulations that had been very Criticized by the population in recent months.-The rules for \"perfecting\" non-state work entered into force on 7 December, and among the most unpopular were those that restricted the capacity of private restaurants to 50 chairs per establishment, forbade the employed to have two Licenses to carry out different activities and forced the workers to open an account at the bank in which they had to reflect all their activities.-Many of the employed and owners of palates had expressed discontent at the seminars organized by the authorities to explain the new regulations, and the most buoyant businesses had begun firing their employees because of the brake Bureaucratic force that forced them to reduce their capacity. But on Wednesday night, the announcement of the repeal was lived with real euphoria in these establishments. In a well-known Italian palate, the owner pressed his fists and leaped with joy to hear the minister of Labour and Social Security, Margarita González: \"My Mama! Those who had to leave tomorrow are saved. \"-González herself, who was in charge of defending the restrictions until days before, was the one who announced the reverse on television with the argument that the critical opinions of the employed had been taken into account and that it was also done not to discriminate against The private workers of the state, where it is permissible the moonlighting. The countermeasures were immediately published in the Official Gazette, something that also draws attention, because normally in Cuba legal times are more paused.-Although it was not published in the official press and only knew the most informed, the change was precipitated on Monday in the Faculty of Law, during a visit made by President Miguel Díaz-Canel. During an exchange with students and professors, the heir of Raúl Castro criticized without ambages the limit of the 50 chairs and the prohibition that a person could not have more than one license, said that that did not have feet nor head and announced to the auditorium that it was going to Beg. At that moment, one of the jurists says there, the auditorium stood up and ovationed him. With this surprising change of course, rectification, updating or whatever you want to call it, Diaz-Canel adopts, without doubt, the most popular measure of his mandate, which began in April when the presidency happened to Raúl Castro, who promoted in 2010 an opening of the sector Private. In Cuba, 157,000 workers were self-employed; Today there are 589,000, 13% of those occupied in the country.-Although the scope is limited, because not only of palates lives the man or of them depends the development of the country, the fact has national impact and many have read it in political key: \"Díaz-Canel has heard the criticisms and rectify something that was a nonsense , and in that sense expresses a will and legitimizes itself, \"commented the owner of a private business usually critical of the government's decisions. It pointed out, moreover, another interesting thing: the normal so far, when there was an unpopular decree which one decided not to apply for counterproductive, is that it will not be executed and point. But to recognize in public and with laws the error, is a novelty. \"And that, in the conditions of Cuba, is a brave thing,\" he pointed.-Until now the restriction of the 50 chairs existed, but the owners of palates were worth several loopholes to expand the capacity, for example having two or three licenses in the same premises. The new Decree-Law establishes that the boundary will now be \"in correspondence with the capacity of the locals.\" Many would like in Cuba to continue with that line.",

            "text_joined": "On November 18, the Latina District Board presented a poster in honor of Yolanda Gonzalez, a student leader abducted and shot dead in 1980, when she was 19, by militants of the ultra-right-wing party new force. A week later, the plaque appeared tainted by a swastika, as if someone wanted to add to the murder of the young woman the death of her memory. Last weekend, a neighbor found the commemorative plaque in the trash and decided to make it safe saving in his apartment. Someone had ripped off the plate, leaving only the mast that held it. The neighbors replaced it with a laminated poster.-This is what is read in the commemorative sign: \"Yolanda González Martín. She was a student leader, worker and militant of the Socialist Workers ' Party. He fought for real democracy, justice and social and labour rights. In February 1980, she was abducted at her home in Aluche and killed by a fascist commando. I was 19 years old. These gardens are dedicated to his remembrance, which is still alive. \"-\"It gives rage. It produces pain. It is the best reflection of what is and remains the right and violent totalitarianism, which takes the front of everyone who does not think like them, \"laments Mar Noguerol, who shared the floor with Gonzalez and her boyfriend until that Friday February 1, 1980 , when the Ultrarightist Emilio Hellín kidnapped and killed in a wilderness with the collaboration of other Ultras. \"It was a woman who had things very clear, very independent, firm, idealistic, as we were all the people of that generation that we cast massively to the streets and militancy to end the dictatorship and that the transition was not something half\" Reasons. \"Sixteen years old, he became interested in politics. He came to Madrid for love, to start a life with his partner, \"go on. \"They came to live at my house, to the splicing floor, where they took it,\" he adds. And he laments, \"It has cost Me years to return.\"-There it is a floor of 60 square meters in the number 101 of the street Tembleque, in the Madrid district of Aluche. The place to which it moves González, a Basque girl daughter of Burgos emigrated, to live with Alejandro Arizcun, her boyfriend. Installed in it participates in demonstrations by the democracy and lives with passion its militancy, dividing its time between the work of cleaner and the studies of electronics. It's the place where it all ended that February 1, 1980.-Someone's knocking on the door. On the floor are not Noguerol or your partner. Gonzalez opens the door. On the other side are the members of the group 41, a criminal gang related to the ultra-right-wing force new. The following is recorded in the Hemerotechs and in the judicial archives. They reduce it. They search the floor for evidence linking it to ETA, although Gonzalez has nothing to do with the terrorist band. They put her in a car. Struggle. They interrogate her during the journey. They arrive in a wilderness near the road that connects Alcorcón and San Martín de Valdeiglesias. And there, in the middle of nowhere, I descerrajan three shots. \"New force militants murdered Yolanda Gonzalez\", titled On the cover Country shortly thereafter.-It has been almost 40 years of that terrible crime that shocks the country and seems drawn from a thriller, because it includes until the escape of the murderer to Paraguay. However, the plaque that reminds the murder victim has not lasted a month.-\"It's inexplicable,\" says Carlos Fonseca, author of Don't Forget Me. Yolanda González, the most brutal crime of the transition (planet), a work that reconstructs the life of the young woman through the testimonies of her relatives, photographs and documents. \"Yolanda was not the leader of any party, nor was he a particularly significant person,\" continues this long-standing journalist. \"She was killed with viciously,\" she laments. and stresses: \"I do not fit in the head what I hate or what can there be to a girl murdered in such a brutal way 38 years ago and whose crime, in quotation marks, was to be a young woman of the left and of her time.\"-\"A neighbor of the neighborhood found the plaque in a dumpster, was angry, recovered and warned us,\" rebuilds Carlos Sanchez Mato (IU), who chairs the municipal board. \"That plaque is no longer worth anything, since it is damaged, but at the same time it is worth a lot, because it shows that in Madrid there are people who are worth it,\" he adds, referring to the neighbors. \"When we did the inauguration, there were threats. They are cowards that all they do is miserable performances like plucking a plaque in memory of a student killed by fascists, \"he adds. \"That's abject,\" he stresses. \"And of course, we're going to replenish it. A thousand times. As necessary. \"-Stay with us today in Facebook, Twitter and our neighbors ' backyard in Instagram",
