        "The Government of Navarra, within the Skolae program to promote equality in the educational system, has decided to censure several songs by machists. A decision that has generated a great deal of controversy in the last few hours. ",
        "Among the topics, not only do we find reggaeton songs, but also Spanish pop. ' Without You I am nothing ' of Amaral, ' with You ' of the song of the Madman, ' had so much to give ' of Nena Daconte or ' I hope you sit ' of Shakira are some of the songs that promote the machismo and the violence of gender according to the program of the Government of Navarra. ",
        "These songs will be banned in schools to prevent them from being a bad influence for teenagers aged 12 to 16. Teachers in the centers of the autonomous Community will not be able to use the topics included in the list in their classes. ",
        "For the moment, Dani Martín has been the only artist that appears in the list that has shown his opinion. \"It's about time you censurarais a song like ' Contigo ', written by me, dedicated to the affection that the public makes us come. Congratulations, that is the fight against machismo, that is the beginning of a value-packed education! Dani Martín, what a macho shit! \"He has written in an ironic tone on Twitter. "
