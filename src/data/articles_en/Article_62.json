        "A 28-year-old woman has died after drowning in her partner's semen while practicing oral sex before sexual intercourse. The tragic death occurred in a hotel room in the Brazilian city of Natal, according to the Peruvian newspaper ' América TV '.",
        "Some Latin American media have made a pun and have titled ' Drowned In Love ', as the couple was celebrating Valentine's Day. However, the woman was married and at the time of the incident the lover phoned the husband because he was frightened and told him everything that was happening. ",
        "\"I cried and yelled on the phone and said, ' run, come here that your wife is dying choking on my semen, '\" he said. The husband thought it was a joke and that could not be possible, but his worst nightmares came true as soon as he arrived at the hotel and received the call from the hospital confirming the death of his wife after choking on the lover's semen."
