        "Joji, a 50-year-old Japanese, died half a year ago crushed in his home by a somewhat peculiar avalanche: a collection of adult magazines. However, the body has recently been discovered, after the landlord, missed by not receiving the rent payments for months, will pass through the house where he resided.",
        "There he found a large stack of magazines of pornographic content, under which were the mortal remains of the tenant, according to the newspaper Metro. ",
        "The images of what happened have been filtered to the media through the cleaning forces that came to the scene, even though the relatives have tried to carry out the event in the most discreet way possible. They have also been the ones who have revealed that the collection surpassed the six tons of weight and that it was distributed in all the corners of the house. ",
        "The investigation is still open, as it is lacking to confirm whether the deceased suffered a heart attack before being crushed by tons of paper."
