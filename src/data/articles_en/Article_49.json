These controls will double in the whole Spanish territory highlighting even more in the tourist areas in order to deter the drivers who drink take the car and so our roads are safer.", "One of the drawbacks of increasing controls is the important expenditure that the Civil guard has to assume as the annual security budgets are already closed until next year they would not receive any more money. That is why the Guardia Civil will be obliged to collect the mouthpieces of the breathalyzers from next September 1 in order to cover this increase in spending. It has been determined therefore that drivers who undergo a control of sobriety should pay the amount of €1 per nozzle and €2 in case they give positive. These amounts must be paid instantly for what is recommended to drivers who have change because if the driver does not pay this new rate at the time of control would face a penalty of up to €50. ", "\"It is important that drivers take into account that we do all this for their safety, and they will carry the mouthpiece of remembrance,\" explains the spokesman for the Guardia Civil. You will also be given the possibility for drivers to contribute their own mouthpiece so they will not be charged this new rate."], "url": "https://haynoticia.es/partir-del-1-septiembre-las-boquillas-los-alcoholimetros-seran-pago4444/", "fake": true}
