Ikea decided not to denounce the client, but has denied access to any of its facilities. \"It took 20 minutes with an impressive stomach ache. I tried to find a bathroom but that's a maze and I had no choice but to do it where I could. \" The entire Ikea plant had to be evicted by the strong smell so the store estimates a loss of about €130,000. \"We are not going to take legal action against the customer, but please do not re-appear in any of our facilities,\" explains Jordi Muñoz, communications director at Ikea.", "The bathroom where the Lord made his needs had to be destroyed and the Ikea store in Oviedo will remain closed around two weeks, time necessary for its decontamination."], "url": "https://haynoticia.es/expulsado-ikea-cagar-bano-muestra5/", "fake": true}
