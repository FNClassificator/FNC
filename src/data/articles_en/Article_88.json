We can say that the health of Bitcoin is at a good time, as it has been able to recover smoothly from the ups and downs it had suffered during 2017. We have to bear in mind that during the 2017 the Bitcoin reached a really spectacular price, in the month of December it reached a price close to the 20,000 USD, and nevertheless in January 2017 the price was only close to the 1000 USD. This vertiginous evolution that the Bitcoin suffered during 2017, managed to propitiate some destabilization in the Criptomoneda, which today has already managed to get rid of, thanks to a sensible evolution that today places its valuation close to the 8200 USD. \n            if (window. innerWidth < = 650) {document. write (\"< div id = ' DFP-Steal-1 ' class = ' banner banner-R ' data-banner = ' Steal-1 ' data-size = ' mobile ' > <script> googletag. cmd. push (function () {Googletag.

We have to take into account that even though today the world of the Criptomonedas has evolved a lot, and there are many Criptomonedas, with Bitcoin started everything, and that is why it is important to try to understand what happens with the original Criptomoneda. It is important to note that it is not necessary to have technical knowledge to understand what the Criptomonedas are and how the Bitcoin works.\nWhat happened to the Bitcoin?\nThe Bitcoin has hoarded unprecedented popularity in recent years, mainly due to the impressive rise in its valuation during the year 2017. As previously discussed, and to put in context, on January 1, 2017, the Bitcoin price was close to 1000 USD, however, at the end of the year, in December 2017, the price was around 20,000 USD, a spectacular rise for just a Period of one year. It is impossible to compare this impressive rise in the Bitcoin with any other type of financial asset.\nWhat happened was that the Bitcoin went down to lows close to 5800 USD last June, and yet today it is recovering by reaching approximately 8200 USD. Although it may seem that there is a very exaggerated fluctuation, the truth is that during this year Bitcoin is keeping quite stable, without growths as pronounced as those that were experienced in 2017, and that began to be really impressive to From November 2017. \n            if (window. innerWidth < = 650) {document. write (\"< div id = ' DFP-Steal-2 ' class = ' banner banner-R ' data-banner = ' Steal-2 ' data-size = ' mobile ' > <script> googletag. cmd. push (function () {Googletag.

Many self-proclaimed finance gurus had predicted that this was the end of Bitcoin, and nothing farther from reality. More and more people are betting on making transactions with Bitcoin, or using Bitcoin as an investment tool. While it is true that it has high volatility, it is also true that all financial assets have a high volatility. Bitcoin is something new, which is logically exposed to aggressive speculative behaviors, such as those that it suffered during 2017, but of which it has certainly come out gracefully and ready to offer the best version of itself to the market.\n\n"], "url": "https://www.elplural.com/economia/precio-bitcoin-sube-de-nuevo_200791102", "fake": false}
