Less than a month ago a mother with a girl in her arms was persecuted and harassed by a group of men in one of the busiest areas of Tangier for wearing a tight dress that showed her legs. It is the daily bread on the beaches of the area, as indicated by those who claim a few kilometres of sand and sea, free of men, riveted gazes and non-pleasing words.-We can create ' recreational spaces ' for Muslim women only-Well, the for some crazy proposal has already arrived in Spain in the form of electoral candy.

euphemisms and a much more terrestrial language: From now on, transsexuals will be able to travel for free by metro and by bus to the capital. Just like that.-This has been done by the Madrid City Council of Manuela Carmena this Wednesday through an official statement.-The initiative is part of the sealed pact between the consistory, the EMT and the transexual-Spanish transsexual association.  -\"These passes will be distributed by the association between the persons users of their services, in consideration to the respective situations of social exclusion or manifest need that accredit the interested ones in relation to the exercise of their right to the Mobility and displacement. \"-\"Transsexualia is a non-profit organization that aims to promote full integration in the Society of transgender men and women, putting in place measures to ensure their full access to health, education and information resources \".-The PP also gives free passes to the metro for transgender Madrid-As strange and surreal as it may seem, the privilege of travelling for free in public transport is not an idea that emanates only from the Podemita town hall of Manuela Carmena.-The former president of the community of Madrid, the popular Cristina Cifuentes, also started a campaign in 2016 to ensure free transportation to all Madrid transexuals. In its case, 38 annual free movement passes by Metro. -The votes of the LGBT lobby increasingly count, and their support can be decisive and the balance to be decanted in an election.-It should be recalled that in March of last year the new \"Law of transsexuality\" of Madrid, which imposes the theory of gender in the public and private school of the capital of Spain, was carried out. All the groups were in favor, except for the PP, which abstained.-Then, they still wonder why the People's Party has lost much of its electorate.-\"They gave them a choice between dishonor or war, Elegísteis

As every 2nd of January, the Andalusian City Council commemorates with great solemnity the victory of the Catholic monarchs and the expulsion, after centuries of reconquest, of the Moslem armies of the peninsula.-After almost ten years of war, in 1491, the Catholic monarchs put siege to the capital of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada. His fall was already a matter of time.-According to the story, Isabel I of Castile not only intended to conquer the city, but to go even further and end, once and for all, with the Islamic power in the peninsula, which extended for more than 800 years.-When he entered Malaga (1487) He closed his port and the possible military aid that could come from the Muslim kingdoms of the Maghreb. The taking of Baza, at the other end of the kingdom, marked another turning point in the offensive.-Granada resisted them and it was in the area where Fernando and Isabel concentrated all their efforts. The pressure of the combined forces of Castile and Aragon was directed on the capital in order to end the resistance by a single blow. They planted their camp in what we now know as Santa Fe.-After 18 months of terrible siege, the end came by hunger, by the military pressure and, according to historical sources, by the bribe to several notable nasrid courtiers, who promised to preserve their properties and their social position and give them certain Mercedes. On January 2, 1492, the armies of Sultan Boabdil surrendered and were expelled from the country.-The last stronghold of Muslim power in Spain disappeared since the year 711. The reconquest was over. The unification of the Spanish kingdoms was already a fact. He had just written one of the most glorious pages in our history.-However, as with the ' Discovery of America ', the controversy continues to accompany the one that should be a date of celebration and fraternization between Spaniards. We continue to be ashamed of our own past.-Open grenade platform calls for ban on ' taking grenade '-In parallel with the official acts, the ' Open Granada platform ' will celebrate this year a new edition of the alternative ' Toma No, Mariana yeah ' with the Arab Foundation, this time around the figure of the poet Federico García Lorca, who will claim to To show their rejection of a celebration that they consider \"xenophobic\" and \"anachronistic\".-The events, which will start at 11.00 hours, will feature the presence of Hispanist and expert in Lorca Ian Gibson, in addition to a poetic reading by Ángeles Mora, a concert of Andalusian music and a flamenco recital by the singer Juan Pinilla.-The spokesman for the platform, Francisco Vigueras, has recalled that García Lorca was contrary to the celebration of the Take and spoke \"of the Gypsy, the Black, the Jew and the Moorish that we all carry inside.\" The opposite, he said that he advocates the celebration of the takeover, which implies \"the rupture of Democratic coexistence\", as it has become a celebration that uses the \"far right grenadine\" to sing slogans \"xenophobic\", \"Islamófobas\" and \"racist\".-For this reason, the platform has reclaimed the Granada City Council to eliminate the celebration of the take as it is currently conceived and to turn it into a \"festival of cultures\". In addition, it bets that on January 2 cease to be local party, in favor of May 26, day of Mariana Pineda. In fact, according to Vigueras, on May 26th was the local festival in Granada before Francoism, and it was the dictator who decided to change it to January 2 to celebrate the taking of the city by the Catholic Monarchs, a party that \"is no longer sustainable in democracy \".-The bases of We can in Granada qualify of ' genocide ' the ' taking of Granada '-Another of the groups that already openly showed their rejection of the celebration of the ' take of Granada ' were the

president of Carles Puigdemont's cover, is well known for his activity in social networks and, above all, for his schizophrenic tweets written between 2011 and 2015 against Spain and what our country represents. However, in 2016 decided to delete all traces of his past Tuitero and create a new account and profile in which we have also found some controversial pearls that allow us an idea of the true profile of the new applicant to tenant of the Plaza Sant Jaume.-Already in the Eighties he wrote in a pamphlet that the Autonomous University of Barcelona is preserved with the differences between the so-called Catalan and Spanish races. They drank from the same sources as Pujol and Barrera to illuminate such texts:--It has been considerable despite the fact that the influence of Arabs and Moors, which have been mixed with the autochthonous ones, especially in the South, is not definitive, giving a crossbreeding that is recognized by external morphological characters (darker and curly hair and more skin color Dark and that it is due to a greater pigmentation power and not to the sun), in addition, the anterior mandibular angle is inferior to that of Catalan. It can be considered Spanish aal as an element of the white race in a frank evolution towards the racial component African and Semitic (Arab).--The IQ of a Spaniard and a Catalan according to the statistics published by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Science, gives a clear advantage to the Catalans.--The progressive Spanish racial degradation can be spread to the Catalans because of the strong immigration. The fruits can be seen if we observe the difference of character between the man of the field, not contaminated by the Spanish saga, and that of the cities. The working and European character of Catalan is a well-disganduling and pro-African psychic factor of Spanish.--For all that we have to consider that the Catalan racial configuration is more purely white than Spanish and therefore Catalan is superior to Spanish in the racial aspect.-– \"The Spaniards in Catalonia are like energy: they do not disappear, they transform themselves.\"-– \"French and Spanish share the same annihilating conception of the nations that live in their states.\"-– \"Be joking. Gentlemen, if we continue here a few more years we run the risk of ending as crazy as the Spaniards themselves. \"-– \"We Catalans go in private cars and we pay for everything. We don't do like the Spaniards do. \"-– \"Above all, what is surprising is the tone, the rudeness, the Spanish Pijería, the feeling of filth.\"-– \"We Catalans vote and the Spaniards come here to watch over us. Get out of here at once. Let us live in peace! \"-– \"Shame is a word that the Spaniards have removed from their vocabulary for years.\"-– \"Hearing Albert Rivera speak of morality is like hearing the Spaniards speak of democracy.\"-– \"The Spaniards only know how to plunder.\"--[to the PSC] \"poor, speak Spanish as the Spanish.\"- Apology of \"Nosaltes Sols\"-Torra renews the racist tradition and vindicates groups like Estat Català and Nosaltes Sols, \"Pioneers of the Independence\". \"They had always been there, kept the flame of the memory by a small but most faithful number of followers, far, however, of the majority catalanism, which transited on another sidewalk\", wrote in an article (2014) in the newspaper the Punt-Avui. And he added: \"In these hundred years in which Catalanism sighed to find a rift in which to fit a common project for Spain, they had already realized the absurdity of this madness under monarchies, republics, dictatorships or democracies. When the budgets and pacts of governability were passed year after year, they warned that Spain Expoliaba us. When the demonstrations shouted \"Som una born\", they pointed out that a nation without a state is a safe wreck. When for some, caught in the Spanish web, everything seemed so complicated, they instead posed simple and clear arguments: freedom, democracy, social justice, Catalan state.-The flame of the characters who admires Torra is still very alive. Proof of this is the Moviment Identitari Català, who hastened to congratulate the character without disguising his enthusiasm.

That same night, or the next day, or in the interval of the following week, officials of the Jugendamt (German institution in charge of the protection of the Children), accompanied by police officers, have the legal faculty to be able to transfer to the children of the \"Racist\" surfer to a children's re-education center, protected by the state. The following consequence of the \"bad\" use of the expressive freedom, or of expressing opinions considered \"racist\", according to the criterion of the German authorities, will surely be the loss of the custody of the children, that could be given for adoption to families Nothing suspicious of harboring doubts about the official morality imposed by the Masters of the moment.-A publication of German lawyers has dared to denounce these measures of Orwellian nature. It announces that there have already been many cases of children snatched from their parents, all of them native Germans. Among the causes that have led to the loss of child custody, criticism of immigration and ideological indoctrination in schools is cited as the most numerous.-The same publication details that, once separated from their parents, the state takes charge of the temporary re-education of the children, who are indoctrinated on the ideas related to the process of social engineering assumed by the majority of European States , including the gender ideology, the admission of homosexuality as a preferential sexual option, the acceptance of multiculturality as advantageous for the Germans and the imposition of an alternative morality in matters relating to the family, religion , national sentiments and attachment to tradition, among others.-Many German parents have already denounced this \"strategy of terror\" that has been set in motion and of which the mass media is barely speaking.-The complainants also refer to the \"coercive environment\" that lives within the families of the country, as evidenced by the fact that parents do not dare to comment on issues of public interest in the presence of their children. It underlines that JUGENDAMT officials regularly attend schools and daycare centres to elicit information to children about their parents ' views on certain subjects.-As you can see, the repression for the implementation of the globalist agenda, even using the weakest and most vulnerable sector of the population, is already exhibited without masks or disguises in Angela Merkel's Germany.

Barcelona at half past three in the afternoon of October 7th. Albert Rivera, leader of the Citizens party, must travel to Madrid. Once in the airport security checkpoint, when passing under the arc, the machine decided that it played a random control.-The president of the Orange formation, instead of acting as one more citizen, and submitting to compulsory random control, allowed his bodyguards to prevent the Prat's private security officers from doing their job.- According to the digital Catalunnyapress, the security members of Rivera refused to have the politician pass the \"trace test\" that looks for in the suitcase, the clothes and the skin of the traveler traces of explosive material.-One of Rivera's bodyguards told them that as an agent of the national Police, he was in charge of the situation. Far from authorizing the Spanish police, the airport vigilantes responded that if the test was not carried out, they should proceed to identify the National police officer with his plaque number as established by the Protocol of action in these cases.-According to the Catalunyapress, an altercation began with a strong discussion between the bodyguards and security guards who have been denounced by a trade union alternative. After a moment of relative calm and when it seemed that it was all over and with Albert Rivera inside the plane, the escorts not satisfied with the performance of the agents of the airport, returned to the arch of control and one of them, in front of the rest of travelers who waited to embark, rebuked the vigilantes saying that \"they had interfered in a Operational \". Always according to the medium quoted, the escort of Albert Rivera \"warned\" the members of security of the airport: \"Next time I put the handcuffs to you\".-Quoted to declare airport workers-The company responsible for private security in El Prat is Trablisa and acts under the supervision of the Guardia Civil. Far from explaining and lowering tensions, the Spanish national Police have denounced the workers and have been summoned at the police station on October 25 at 9.30.-Trace Test-\"The objective of this Community regulation is to increase the inspection of passengers and their hand baggage in safety controls with equipment for detecting substances not allowed inside the aircraft. In this way, if explosives, liquids have been handled, the machine detects it immediately as the control consists of a last generation scanner. \"-Update:-It was not drug control, only explosives as reported by the trade union alternative of Barcelona in a statement.-As the BOE collects, the ETD is: a technological system or a combination of different technologies capable of detecting negligible,

said, there is no international agreement on the definition of the concept of Terrorism. -   It has also shown in favour of an approach of prisoners ETA to Basque prisons when the inmates request it individually and has advocated for investigating what it has called \"human rights violations\" by the forces and bodies of safety authority of the State.  -   \"We cannot define as a terrorist this group or any other because we lack that global common element of the possibility of defining people as terrorists. It is not the fault of amnesty, but in any case, of people who do not agree on the definition, \"said López Borgóñez during his participation in the Forum of the New Society (New Economy Forum).-   When asked specifically why IA does not consider ETA a terrorist group, he explained that \"there is a problem with terrorist terminology.\" \"The word is not the same in each country, there is no international convention in which it is defined. In each country is a different issue that affects people differently, \"he argues. -   \"As they are practices on which each government legislates, when talking about a war on terror all governments are fully in favor because they are the ones who say what terrorism is, so it is enough for any leader to say that something is Terrorism so that it is framed in a standard. \"-   From there, he says that it would look bad that, \"if governments agree and are able to draft legislation, Amnesty International will be able to define from an international perspective the groups committing terrorist acts based on that Def Initiated International. \" -   As for the situation of the prisoners ETA has shown supporter that \"if the prisoners, individually, ask to be near their place of residence, they must be granted.\" \"What cannot be is that they ask for associations or friends. If these cases occur, international standards are clear: people have the right to be near their place of origin, \"he adds. -   It has also argued that \"there can be no impunity for the serious human rights abuses of ETA, but human rights violations committed by the forces and security corps should also be investigated, as recommended by the Rapporteur of the UN for torture and various

A Sánchez le ha dejado muy claro que, de ser él de nuevo presidente del Gobierno, no le apetecería nada depender de Podemos.

'This is what determines it, not the simulation that can be done at one time or another', added Gonzalez at a Europe Press Andalusia informative breakfast organized in Seville with the presence of Susana Díaz.  -A the question of whether would include churches, in a Government, has answered to not create the leader of Podemos 'like much of me', as it can happen to it in the opposite direction, but was declared 'ready to talk to everyone' , although 'there are some elements that could be essential they would very difficult, except that there were convergence of positions'.  -The same way, on the visit of churches to the jail interview with the VicePresident of the Generalitat of Catalonia Oriol Junqueras while the General State budget for 2019, trading Gonzalez pointed out that ' everyone can do what you want with your time ' and in any case he has heard several representatives of the Socialist Executive of Pedro Sánchez clarify that leader can not acted by 'in charge' of the Government, so the purple party representative ' does not appear to be authorized by anyone '.  -En any case, has called the attention that when churches left to meet with the President, Íñigo Urkullu, said that 'we have already done what we had to do, now you move to the Government, also in budgetary matters'. ' Would forgive? Also? What what was that 'also', which seems to be the center of talk? It will be the construction of a Bolivian self-determination plurinationality?', has been questioned Gonzalez.  -El former President has insisted that 'what most struck you the' was 'also' churches slipped 'when it came out see Urkullu', and has commented that the leader of Podemos 'has maximum exposure periods and other immersion and rest'. -About project budgets that the Government has agreed with United we can, González has pointed out that he has seen is that they 'are rather positive' and ' wisely, timidly positive ', in addition to ' wisely counter-cyclical, complying with the requirements ' Minister of economy, Nadia Calviño, 'not of the European Union', as it has an Apostille.-En esa línea, ha indicado que la Unión Europea es \"un proceso de cesión de soberanía en cada acuerdo que se toma para compartir\" esa soberanía, \"no para que la ejerza otro a quien pueda echar la culpa de las torpezas de uno\".-On the other hand, the former President of the Government has also ruled on the letter that United we can-in community-in tide has referred to the Royal House aimed at Juan Carlos I asking for it to appear at his own request in the Congress of Deputies, in order that explain 'its institutional activity as head of the State' for more than 38 years and as Emeritus King from 2014, and rinse if you are involved in cases of corruption.-In this regard, former President pointed out that it is 'an exponent' of the 'Cavalry species' who believes that it occurs now 'against the monarchic institution and the head of State', and RIP has indicated that when this ' arises from the separatists is thinks that they are against King Philip because it is monarchy or by Oct. 3 speech ' of 2017, even though, as he recalled, before that day occurred the August attacks in Catalonia, 'and the disqualifications and screams' when the monarch travelled to Barcelo NA to participate in the demonstration against such terrorist acts 'were the same as after 3 October'.-In that sense, he has opined that 'If instead of the King Felipe was the earlier or President of the Republic would be shrugging it off as President of the Republic'. 'They want to raise a problem that does not exist because they can't solve the problems that exist,' he added.-González ha hablado de un \"interés liquidacionista\", de \"desestabilizar\", y ha

journalist.-A body usually friendly and has the sympathy of the citizens, firefighters, but they are organizing in authentic \"guerrilla groups\" with the tortious intention to be a key piece in their desire to create the ' Catalan Republic '.-They, the firefighters who charge generous soils of the public administration, were already an important element of agitation during the days before and after the illegal referendum of October 1, coming to harass and harass the police officers National and Civil guard who were part of the operation of the Ministry of the Interior. They did so by using the official fire trucks and their uniforms in a clearly challenging attitude and in front of the hotels where the agents were staying.-And since then they have not stopped their efforts and have organized themselves. assemblies, clandestine meetings (even during the service) and design of future actions mark the day-to-day of most of the firefighters operating in Catalonia and who are willing to \"fight for the Republic\", as they argue. They want to move into action and arm themselves (for the time being without firearms, to which they still do not have access) but violence is a way they want to use.-There is some police concern about the development of events. The Catalan firefighters count so far with all the free way in their dark undemocratic and violent intentions. In addition, they enjoy the sympathy of the operational commands of the Mossos d ' Quadra. The Catalan police will not stop them in their efforts: look the other way.-They are already a kind of \"outpost\" of a ' guerilla Catalana '. In fact, in their official vehicles they show it and they do not hide a violent warning in their lettering: ' Bombers in Lluita ', said in Castilian, \"firefighters in struggle\".

Even so, it should be noted that, for the first time, Brussels would be studying and assessing the possibility of that bullfighting was banned in Spain.-Elevando su petición a Bruselas, se pretende que España se convierta en uno de esos 65 países que ya han desarrollado leyes para la protección y defensa de los derechos de los animales. “De la misma manera que la protección del medio ambiente se convirtió en un nuevo campo del derecho internacional a finales del siglo pasado, la protección del bienestar animal es una preocupación creciente en el comienzo de este nuevo milenio”, asegura para denunciar que “el hombre ha pasado de domesticar o comerse un animal a esclavizarlo y muchos pensamos que eso en inaceptable en el siglo XXII”.-Therefore, 'the abolition of bullfighting in Spain and all varieties of festivities for breaking not only the rights of animals, but also those of childhood' he asked before the European Parliament in 2014. Now, in 2016, the Parliament's Committee on Petitions has answered your demand. ' I am pleased to inform you that has begun the review of your request. The Committee on Petitions considers that it meets the requirements of admission ', reads the letter you received.-“Para ser la primera petición que entregamos, sabiendo todas las rechazadas, y siendo un grupo de amigos voluntarios, sin presupuesto, infrastucturas,  ni un local siquiera, supera cualquier expectativa que hubiéramos podido imaginar” ha explicado en declaraciones a ELPLURAL.COM Del Cerro. Sobre todo si se tiene en cuenta que otras organizaciones, de renombre e incluso con representación en el Congreso de los Diputados después de estas elecciones del 20-D, como es el partido animalista PACMA, llevan una década presentando peticiones similares. Todas infructuosas.-' I want to emphasize that the real importance of this admission to procedures is that the PACMA 10 years ago who reject them systematically request the theme of cultural tradition ', added. ' Toro de la Vega has always has presented and recognizing that it is a medieval Spanish tradition. They gave them the reason in advance and refused it is. We've done it the other way around. Who said that it is a Spanish tradition? And furthermore have shown it '.-No es cultura ni tradición española-According to defend the animal in his writing, celebrations or bullfights ' have never been neither culture nor Spanish tradition ' and Moreover, ensures that ' Spaniards, not invented it if not entertainment of masses across Europe, which for centuries was until its abolition When he came the enlightenment in the 18th century '.-Leaving aside the 'so-called Spanish traditions', of the Hill has not hesitated to throw legal texts and, point by point, go by disassembling and explaining each of the rights, resolutions and texts that are violated by the bullfighting in our country, starting by the defended in the United Nations Organization for education, science and culture organization (UNESCO).-The petition stresses that any celebration that carry the suffering of an animal does not meet the requirements of this body because ' does not have the acceptance and does not generate pride in the majority of the citizens of the countries and the cities in which takes place , which was clearly manifested through its banning in Catalonia and the Canary Islands '.-Hundreds of activists and supporters of the collective AnimaNaturalis and PETA have protested today at the plaza de toros de Pamplona against the bullfights that next week will take place in the arena on the occasion of the Festival of San Fermin.-It does not respect the rights of the child-Similarly, it argues that several articles of the Declaration of the rights of the child of 1959 are clearly violated. In this text is recognized in article 10 'the right to be raised in a spirit of understanding, tolerance, friendship' of what emerges, in his opinion, that ' there are away from children's participation and observation of events and performances involving the suffering and mistreatment of animals, as a way to achieve a future society more peacefully and with greater empathy for the suffering and to reject any form of violence '.-To the extent that the Committee on the rights of the child of the United Nations, in his report of 31 January 2014 shows favour a 'possible' prohibition of the participation of minors in bullfighting, both being bullfighters as spectators.-Inconsistent with the Universal Declaration of the rights of animals-In 1997, UNESCO and the United Nations approved the Declaration Universal rights of animal that is manifestly incompatible with the celebration of bullfighting.-'Any animal has the right to respect', 'man, as animal species, cannot be attributed the right to exterminate the other animals or exploit them, violating that right' or 'no animal shall be subjected to ill-treatment or cruel acts' are just some of its articles.-Admitted

No? Well, it doesn't matter. Surely someone has told you a similar anecdote and you have been in pictures. How can you drink hot water to quench your thirst instead of taking it cold or even icy as you like in the middle of summer? Well, there is a study published in the European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical Research that speaks of five risks.-It interferes with digestion. Believe it or not, this is the case according to this study, which says verbatim that it may be \"unfavorable to the digestive tract.\" This is why many people always believe that it is not a good idea to drink water after food and that it should only be taken while the food is being taken. The study delves into the question by explaining that, by drinking very cold water, the body devotes energy to regulating body temperature rather than digesting food.-Fattening. The same study still dislikes us. He also points out that the habit can become fattening. The key is based on research that too cold water can harden fat from consumed foods and thus create fat deposits in the intestine. We repeat that it is the European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical Research that says it, Ojo.-It can cause sore throat. Well, well. Here is a warning that we have been hearing for years and years and to which we have never made the slightest case. Well, apparently it's true. \"Drinking cold water helps to form an extra mucus in the body, which can make our body more prone to catch a cold.\" What we lacked.-It can cause dehydration. That is to say, to provoke the opposite effect that we seek when we drink a glass of cold water. What happens in this case is that it causes a contraction of the blood vessels, which can lead to the favor of dehydration. So surprising and because of a too low temperature of H2O.-It affects the immune system. When it seemed that nothing worse could happen to us because of the cold water intake, we found another side effect. Apparently, it also causes a fall in the heart rate, according to another study prepared by the Taiwan Institute of Traditional Medicine.

unbearable. The company worker they have hired to clean up vomits up three times on the street. It stinks at a distance. At the door, he barely holds out for a few seconds. The stench of shit gets inside the body. The citizens ' headquarters (Cs) in Hospitalet (Barcelona) is a favorite objective of the independentists. It is the most attacked of the orange Formation in all Spain: 12 rounds since its opening in the year 2015, the last one on day of Sant Jordi (April 23). Nine of them using fecal feces. \"It is degrading,\" laments Miguel García, spokesman for Cs in Hospitalet.-The second municipality of Catalonia in inhabitants is not a particularly radical stronghold. But for the positions of citizens it has become a hell. They spend more time without being able to use their headquarters than in it. Every few months, hooded people dump buckets of animal feces against it, as the security cameras reveal. \"The smell disables the seat for a month. It's impossible to be inside. When the stench goes, they attack us again. I think this is violence, ' Garcia argues. -The members of Cs de Hospitalet will not forget the Sant Jordi of 2018. Hours after the attack to their headquarters, while they were in their tent as every year, a hooded with yellow ribbon came up to her. \"Nazi dogs, we're going to kill you,\" was his greeting. He hung himself from the tent, folded it, knocked the table down a kick, threw a kick at a gentleman, whom he never reached, and ran away. The Mossos managed to stop him. They put a complaint. Another. -\"We live in grievances and humiliation,\" laments Garcia. \"But we are aware that we have to fight because if not they [the independenceists] have won.\" The smell of shit still invades him. \"Graffitis calling us fascists do not like you, but you clean them at the moment. It doesn't degrade you. But fecal feces... ' They have not calculated how much money they have spent over the years to repair each attack. They believe that the three most serious (facade and broken crystals and sprinkled with a strong smell product) can be around 3,000 euros. -Garcia thinks a few seconds in search of why this fixation against them and their headquarters. They see us as enemies. We defend a way of doing politics, of country. They refuse to vote in Parlament initiatives that condemn this type of violence. They don't because violence is part of their life, their message and strategy. We condemn all kinds of violence. ' -Think again. Avoid generalizing. \"Not all independentists are violent.\" And remember that Monday, with its headquarters full of shit, a person with a yellow ribbon walked past and stopped. \"I can't even see you, I don't want you in painting, but this is degrading. I do not share it, ' he told Garcia, who recognizes that ' we must not criminalize all. But it is the guilt of the one who encourages it. -The team of citizens in Hospitalet is dawning every morning with the uncertainty of what they will find in their headquarters. Also the neighbors of the building, tired of withstanding acts vandalism and smells pests every little time. \"The neighbors are very tired,\" Garcia acknowledges. \"They come down to complain.\" Some have asked them to leave. They fear that what today is a bucket of shit tomorrow is a Molotov cocktail. We can't leave. That's passing the ball to other neighbors. The full democracy is to be able to settle where one wants».-Garcia always returns to an argument: \"The independentists excuse the violence.\" He suffered it in a personal way. A year and a half ago I was in a tent distributing leaflets at a flea market. One person approached. \"I'm going to kill you.\" Hit him in the face and on the side. He broke his glasses and provoked a partial rupture of ligament in the knee that still drags. We asked him to leave. He let go of the two dogs he wore, and he took a beating, \"he recalls. When he left, he still pulled down his pants to touch his testicles. He's pending trial. The D.A. asks for three years for hate crimes. -Garcia, like so many other constitutionalist positions in Catalonia, has changed his life. He's stopped doing things, altered habits. \"I, Strange is the day they do not insult me.\" Being with his wife on a terrace, taking something, he has been called \"fascist\", \"Nazi\"... On more than one occasion they have gone without finishing what they had asked for. His wife now checks the terraces from a distance to see if they can sit or not. With some neighbors, those who even entered his house, no longer spoken. \"It's violent when you cross the elevator. That passive violence is palpable, the looks of hatred. \" -Garcia promises to keep cleaning shit up. We can't leave him. If we do, we've lost the battle for freedom. This gives us more strength to fight. Catalan society has to be free.

comply conviction for a crime committed when he was 18 years old-Count back finished ten minutes before seven in the evening, when the marked time was fulfilled. Alejandro Fernández, aged 24, deducts from Tuesday the six years of imprisonment that must be met by a ruling of the Supreme Court to use a counterfeit card and organized - T-shirt, band membership beard of few days and accompanied to the last second by a stable partner, Alejandro entered prison provincial of Albolote, where should expect a final hope: a partial pardon that provide him the third degree.-All for a purchase of 79'20 euros six years ago in an establishment of Malaga through a counterfeit card that you provided - says - who then considered his friend. Demonstrations and props of the last days are, for the moment, out of the reach of who is now one inmate of the prison of Granada. Resigned to not having prospered the efforts at various levels tried to mobilize, Alejandro had voluntarily in the solanera which fell without mercy on the Esplanade prior to the jail at that time. -Negative reports of the national court and the prosecution have played against a suspension injunction of his entry into prison. In his favor he was having employment fixed at a cafe, that their bosses trust you keys and the box, which maintains a stable relationship... None of this has served to the relentless administrative machinery that requires you to pay for a mistake of youth. His lawyer, Javier Gómez Rosales, recalled that the reports are not binding and that the Ministry of Justice could have valued the remaining variables, primarily 'from disproportionate' penalty. -An appeal for reversal is the latest weapon the defense of Alejandro will use from now on, exhausted the countdown since the Supreme Court ruled for the events of that fateful day of 2010 in which accompanied ' to someone who I considered then something well co MO my elder brother ' which, ultimately, would mark a nightmare that would be displayed for all time and successive years. It was 'one man much older than me, at least twenty years' that had known 'because he was a friend of my girlfriend then'. Alejandro a relationship had met him with 16 years, in 2008, ' camaraderie', was 'very wrapped, divertido, invited us all over...' and the 'black date' happens two years later. 'He asked me if he could accompany him to Malaga'. Alejandro nodded. Never did: remember that day in a shop 'with a wallet card that he gave me' on behalf of Alejandro, 'that I had not seen or knew existed'. He was confident in him, to the point of not suspecting that he had falsified a card on your behalf. You are asked to buy alcoholic drinks 'and a shake of chocolate, which I bought for me, because I don't drink alcohol'.-He paid without problems with the card, he returned to the car where expected you this then friend and now disappeared. They went to a Carrefour also in Malaga, 'with another person who just know'. In the Mall they waited in the car while his 'friend' went into the service and dumbfounded, watched how when left 'cops, 'security officer' of the Center surrounded him...'. Without understanding anything, nervous, ' we left the parking lot and parked a couple of streets beyond. We returned to the Carrefour for my friend and now there not passing anything, like a normal day...' Back in the car, 'a police patrol stood to the side', so they decided to return to Grenada in the first taxi that passed.-The verdict that sentenced him remains completely credibility to his version that was unaware that the cards were illegal, on the basis, among other arguments, the fact that occur to escape when police tried to stop them at the exit of the Carrefour. -When he arrived home the police already it had identified through his then partner and told his mother that Monday should occur at police station at 8 in the morning or they will be looking for and capture. It was in the dungeons until Friday, in which it was held the speedy trial that police wanted to because the case had passed the national audience. 'Were there another person also wholesale and which I had accompanied in Malaga'. All were accused of belonging to organized gang and swindle, a few crimes that when they came to trial resulted in convictions of eight years for the first and four more by the second.-Provisionally released since then that has fulfilled arising in Commissioner on 1 and 15th of each month, they sought to reach an agreement with the Prosecutor's Office - year and a half of sentence - which was impossible 'because one wanted to be a civil guard and didn't have a history'. And as 'friend' that is at the origin of everything had disappeared and did not go to trial in the sentence is glimpsed that the tribunal believes that Alejandro and the other two condemned 'loaded to blame because he could not defend himself'. Worth, finally, appealed in the Supreme was six years (four two) by organized gang membership and scam.-18-year-old, Alejandro was a student of FP in the Salesian order. 'My life has changed', says now without understanding how translate 79,20 euro ' in six years in prison, for very counterfeit card to be '.

It is the German Wolgang Schäuble who leads the list, as he already did in 2010. Last year he won the Swedish Anders Borg.-The relative position of Spain has worsened with respect to the list of 2011, in which the then Minister of Economy, Elena Salgado, remained in position 13. Underneath it had Austria, France, Denmark, Hungary, Italy and Greece. His final note was 13, although in credibility was 15, but in politics went to 9.-In the case of Guindos, the global note is 19, in politics 18, in economy with 17 and in credibility 19. The newspaper stresses that Spanish is not the only European minister who has had to deal with recession and unemployment, although some of the economic leaders of these countries such as Ireland, Italy or Portugal improve with respect to last year.-In the specific case of Guindos, the financial newspaper draws attention to the \"complicated institutional framework\" in which it performs its work, in reference to the division between the areas of finance, in the hands of Cristóbal Montoro, and economy.-Financial Times recognizes that Guindos is an experienced economist, has fluent English and is the largest international profile of both, but points out that \"there remains a high degree of frustration for the division of Labor, whose critics believe it has damaged More the government's ability to communicate clearly and coherently with investors from other European capitals. \"-The rotary reference of the City has been doing this classification for seven years. To do so, it rewards those who have found the balance between economic growth and strong public finances, both nationally and internationally. It also analyses whether the respect for financial markets has been gained, although it admits that all of them are arbitrary and subjective elements that may not satisfy everyone.-\"Guindos has not had a good start,\" said Sony Kapoor, one of the experts that the FT considers as the market's judges. Jacques Depla, professor at the Toulouse Business School, believes that his main flaw is that he \"has consistently underestimated the gravity of the housing bubble and the crisis.\"", "title_word":

inaugural speech, the new White House quickly changed hands, analogue and digitally. President Obama's Twitter account became Trump's, and the same thing happened with the White House website, which quickly placed a photo of the new representative on the cover. But that wasn't the only change. In addition to varying and substantially cutting the links to the \"issues\" of the new government — issues featured on the Obama web, such as climate change policy, Cuba, or the nuclear pact with Iran were eliminated — there is another button that disappeared: \"in Spanish.\"-This link linked to the presidency's Spanish-language website and in which, in addition to the main page topics, special interests of the Hispanic community were highlighted, such as Obama's executive actions to temporarily regularize hundreds of Thousands of undocumented youth, the deferred action program known as DACA.-During Obama's two mandates, the White House also held a blog in Spanish with topics of specific interest to the Hispanic community, from immigration issues, to normalization of relations with Cuba, or the economic crisis in Puerto Rico.-Despite the new president's patent predilection for Twitter as a means of communication — in addition to his new official account continues to maintain and use his private — the Spanish version of the White House account has also been paralyzed. The last tweet in Spanish is January 13th, under the account still in the hands of Obama.-Nor is there at the moment, as there was in the Obama era, a press spokesperson specifically dedicated to Spanish-language media and topics of Hispanic interest.-That Hispanics are not a priority for the new President became clear during the long election campaign, in which he demonized Latin American immigrants and put the main country of origin of the Hispanic community of the U.S., Mexico against the ropes. The only expression in Spanish that the then Republican candidate used was the contemptuous bad men he referred to, during the last presidential debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton, to refer to \"illegally dangerous\" immigrants who have promised Deport.-Trump also criticized one of his opponents, Jeb Bush, for speaking Spanish during the campaign.-\"We have a country where, if you want to integrate, you have to speak English. We need to have integration to have a country. I'm not the first to say this. This is a country where we speak English, not Spanish, \"he said during a Republican debate in September 2015.

of the Act of Montes, a standard whose development has been on tenterhooks for nearly two years to environmental organizations. The most controversial point is that opens the possibility of changing the use of burnt land, something that is forbidden during the 30 years after a fire in the current regulations, in 2003. 'There is a risk of becoming to cause fires to allow construction in burned areas,' said ecologists in action.-Article 50 of the draft law includes an exception to the general prohibition: the autonomous communities may agree to the change of forestry use of a burned monte when 'compelling reasons of public interest of the first order'. For SEO/BirdLife, this creates legal uncertainty because it is concepts 'open to interpretation' that could open the door to urban developments on burned land. The Ministry of agriculture, food and environment makes a very different reading: it's preventing that an intentional fire can prevent actions of general interest. The Minister, Isabel García Tejerina, yesterday was an example of what is meant to prevent: announcing the work of a road requiring to expropriate land and the owner and burn it so that it can carry out for 30 years.-Begoña Nieto, directora general de Desarrollo Rural y Política Forestal, admitió que existe la posibilidad de que ocurra lo que denuncian los ecologistas, pero aseguró que es muy remota. “El cambio de uso no es tan sencillo. El texto prevé que se haga mediante una ley autonómica, en un proceso público. Tienen que concurrir razones de interés público de primer orden”, subrayó.-Garcia Tejerina appeared after the Council of Ministers to present the news of the law. Among other things, will regulate the figure of the mountains of partners who occupy and half million hectares in all Spain, so that they can manage without the agreement of all the owners. Nieto explained that it is avoiding the abandonment of mountains in which, over the years, has been blurring the property. Now you can take decisions without the agreement of all the owners.-The new law will create a new figure, forest partnerships, which will allow that forests managed in grouped shape unless the owners lose ownership. ' In Spain there are many mountains that are abandoned and are deteriorating. We want to avoid that abandonment. A managed mount is a mount of care ', said Garcia Tejerina. One of the objectives pursued by the new Act is to simplify instruments of management of forests. It will clarify its classification, dividing them into four categories.-The text will also enable autonomous communities approve technical models most simple and cheap owners to make their own plans of forest management. For grandson, this is the best way to promote these instruments. Ecologistas en Acción considers, however, that the new law eliminates mandatory, in the former, for all the mountains have a management tool. Slightly more than 12% of the forested area in Spain has this type of management. 'It was mandatory, but it did absolutely nothing, did not comply, said Nieto.-Another new feature of the law is a 'national strategy of hunting management' future and a national registry of offenders of hunting and fishing. For ecologists in action these changes have little to do with the management of forests and respond to the PP's good relationship with the hunting sector 'to which favors with these changes'. Nieto said that it is only to coordinate different standards of the communities, for example in the veda or hunting of migratory species.-'It is no coincidence that all the environmental laws of the PP are full of exceptions such as the coastal Act, the law on Natural Heritage and montes', said Pilar Lucio, Secretary general of the PSOE climate change yesterday.-Of Montes current law, in 2003, included as one of its major innovations the ban on changes in forest use of the areas burned at least 30 years. He tried to avoid it caused fires for speculative purposes. Article 50 of the single draft known so far in the new standard, overtaken by the country in March 2013, would ground that caution to include this sentence: ' exceptionally autonomous communities may agree on changes in forest use when If a general interest prevalent '. That sentence has been changed in the text approved in the Council of Ministers.-Garcia Tejerina ruled out during the presentation of the campaign of extinction and forest fire prevention in 2014 that the modification of the current law would include the possibility of selling public montes. The 2013 draft calmed environmentalists at that point because, as drafted, does not allow it. Former Minister Miguel Arias Canete, said environmentalists that the rule ' does not provide' the confiscation. -The news, conducted by this newspaper, that the Government of Castilla - La Mancha had asked its engineers in mountains 50 grounds of public utility that would be interesting to privatize, reports jumped in full elaboration of the new law, which increased the fears of environmentalists and officials of the regional administration. The legal status of the mountains of public utility, therefore stays as it is: are public property, i.e. 'imprescriptible, unattachable and inalienable'.-Ecologistas en Acción has described 'unnecessary and counterproductive' the modification of the law of mountains. For the Organization the changes in the law do not incorporate substantial improvements for the management of forests, invade regional competition because it incorporates hunting regulations and implies a 'major setback' at the necessary forest planning.", "title_word": ["new", "Montes", "law", "allow", "burn", "areas"], "subtitle_word": ["environmentalists", "opposition", "believe", "may",

Subsequently, the grains are impregnated with the typical aroma of rice through vaporization. Physicians have insistently alerted the dangers of consuming this artificial product: Three portions could contain both plastic and a small bag of this material. Alarming!-With these simple tricks you can do the test to know if the rice you eat is healthy and free of plastic:-The water test-Put a spoonful of raw rice in a glass of cold water and shake vigorously. If all the rice sinks in the bottom of the glass, then it is healthy. If the grains float on the surface, watch out!-The Fire test-Try to put some rice on the fire with a match or a lighter. If it burns right away and smells like burnt plastic, then you know what to do! (Don't consume it!)-The mortar and pylon test-When you mash some grains of rice into a mortar, the grains are easily reduced to become a fine, white, starch-like powder. But with the artificial rice you will see, on the other hand, how the grains are dyed slightly yellow.-The Mildew test- If you want to be sure that your cooked rice is completely natural, place a small amount inside an airtight container and leave it in a warm place.

January, to $6.060.- This first stretch of the increase represents the Federal prison service an additional cost of $130 million a year that turns on the economy. The injustice is that a part of those turns come from Anses. It should be recalled that the minimum pension is $3.821,33. A prisoner won 46% more than a retiree. The inmate also has the advantage that wage enjoy it whole because food provides the SPF, just like light, gas and health and education services.- In my book after the walls I alerted about the distortions that it brings to pay this salary every month, instead of delivering it at the end of the sentence as provided for by the law.- But from 2012, when Víctor Hortel was head of the SPF, the rules changed for worse. With a generosity unknown until that time, the minimum wage was extended to almost all prisoners, even to those who did not work. Hortel, which had formed 'Vatayon militant', a group akin to 'La Cámpora', intended to include prisoners in the Kirchner movement. He told them they were going to be part of the revolution and decided to turn them into activists.- A murga was organized to amuse them. Hortel plays very well drummer and saxophone. The murga baptized it 'Black shit', which included femicidas as the murderer of Soledad Bagna. They were going to political rallies with minimum custody. The prisoners were in paradise. They enjoyed unprecedented privileges. Their cells had plasma, stereos. There was touch washing machine and computer games. Sometimes the militants came from visits and pizzas and beers ran by the different pavilions. Porro was part of that feast.- The guards had prohibited recalls in the evening, which gave inmates to manufacture 'facas', tumberos knives.- Meanwhile, distributed at discretion annotations work of 200 hours per month that allow you to fully charge the minimum wage. In Devoto, nobody, it will work or not, was the profit margin. If someone not perceived it made a presentation to the justice and they immediately approved it.- In mid-2012, as almost all of the prisoners were paid the minimum wage they founded the single trade union of workers in private Liberty Street, which adhered to the CTA ruling. Fortunately, the current director of the SPF, Emiliano Blanco, appealed the measure and the legal status is suspended.- But shortly after the Foundation, members of the only Guild of prisoners in the world, declared a strike calling for holiday, ART, banking and that the minimum wage is transformed into an unemployment insurance to continue to charge it when out in freedom. Fortunately they did not get the benefit, but they managed to receive month-to-month salary, eluding the required deposit. The judges garantistas competed with Hortel and human rights organizations to see who gave more benefits to inmates.- Sanctions applied by the guards of the SPF is judicializaron. The punishment for an act of indiscipline or aggression a rare guard time is met because some judge always prevents the sanction.- The minimum wage lost the fundamental reason why was born. It ceased to be a reserve fund for the prisoner who was released. The idea was that when it came out on the street it had resources to keep until I got a job. Recidivism in the Argentina is now almost absolute. The released offenders immediately.- The freedoms that gave Hortel, who came to dress up Spider-man and its directors dressed up as Batman and other characters from comic books during a Carnival celebrated with prisoners, relaxed discipline. They came to organize a dance with dams on one of the churches in one of the prisons. That Yes, had the modesty of cover images of the Virgin Mary, Jesus, Apostles, and saints.- Of course, everything ended when prisoners who palmeaban Hortel and members of 'Vatayon militant' back with who on more than one occasion jumped into the cry of 'which does not jump is a grey', in allusion to the colour of the uniform of the guards It ended with a series of leaks. The most serious was the last, when thirteen prisoners escaped from Ezeiza in 2013.- The inconsistencies of its management, which had the highest budget of history, continue to generate costs. For instance, he built a fishing boat painted blue and white and baptized Néstor Kirchner. Installed a fish-processing plant in the prison of Rawson. The ship cost more than usual, about $8 million. But when was it completed realized that we had to have a fishing permit and there were none for sale because they are too expensive and limited. The ship is now rented by a canon low to a fishing company.- With the proliferation of wages increased corruption in prison. The guards, who had an increase of 24% - less than 28.5% of the minimum wage hike - charge $14 billion per month. With discounts and expenses that have to go to work every day, are near what the prisoners earn.-  There are many who are bribed to not what family members come to watch. Among several prisoners are organized 'vaquita' and pay the guard to get marijuana, alcohol, cocaine, or cell, among other desired items. The minimum wage became a formidable stimulus to the informal economy.- Salary is prisoner in an account or see him as a family member in cash. The case that grant powers to collect various wages to undocumented people is given.- But the prisoner who is a great survivor did not stay still and went to his wit. Bands were organized to stay with as much money as possible. They began to kidnap other prisoners and asked that they will transfer the money to their accounts. On other occasions threatened family members and tell them that they will kill their relative if not the money reaches them.- The current management of SPF which attempted to order the prisons, in fact eliminated the overcrowding, is this enormous power that have prisoners with cash in their pockets, and with relatives in addition to receiving government subsidies.

this Thursday, both the actor Jorge Sanz and the wax Museum of Madrid have become a trend in social networks. All this due to a photograph of the actor next to a statue created \"in its image and likeness\" in the Madrid Wax Museum, who has already generated controversy before by the statues of other personalities such as Fernando Alonso or Rafael Nadal, among others.-After this background, users of social networks decided to get their humor and ingenuity to mess with this figure of wax, which has little to do with the actor in Madrid, and the Museum of Wax in Madrid, who received a large number of criticisms of the statue Qu And little or nothing has to do with Sanz. In the image, the actor appears next to a figure with bulging eyes, gray suit and, if not enough, with a somewhat buxom figure. However, on this occasion, nothing is what it seems.-After becoming a trend, the wax Museum of Madrid has had to go to the pass to deny that the figure is his. Although the photo is taken at the Madrid Museum, the image is part, as explained by the Pinacoteca, the props of a special episode of the series ' What was Jorge Sanz? '.-The comedy created by David Trueba, formed from six episodes in 2010 and a special chapter in 2016, is a false documentary that narrates the adventures of the actor from Madrid, who mocks himself throughout the plot. This special chapter, which will be released on March 4 in Movistar +, narrates how it has changed the life of the actor in Madrid humorously.-In one of the scenes, Sanz goes to the wax museum with the aim of revealing his statue, which turns out to be an unwise figure of the artist. The writers have opted, in a clear tone of humour, to produce a figure that has little to do with the actor, responding to the controversial and unwise versions of other personalities that have been presented in the Art gallery in Madrid.-Little has it mattered to social networks that the wax figure was not really a statue of the wax museum in Madrid. Twitter users have redrawn their wits and have carried out hilarious versions of the wax figure, which have compared, among other things, the famous Ecce Homo in the town of Borja.", "title_word": ["figure", "Jorge", "Sanz", "Wax", "Museum", "Madrid", "horrify", "network"], "subtitle_word": ["Madrid", "museum", "disclose", "prop", "series", "What", "happen", "Jorge", "Sanz"], "positive_words": ["create", "humor", "special", "comedy", "create", "special", "adventure", "special", "clear", "humour", "hilarious"], "negative_words": ["horrify", "mess", "criticisms", "deny", "mock", "controversial"], "common_noun_words": ["figure", "Jorge", "Sanz", "Wax", "Museum", "Madrid", "horrify", "network", "museum", "prop", "series", "Thursday", "actor", "trend", "photograph", "statue", "create", "image", "controversy", "statues", "personalities", "Fernando", "Alonso", "Rafael", "Nadal", "background", "users", "get", "humor", "ingenuity", "mess", "number", "criticisms", "Qu", "nothing", "bulge", "eye", "suit", "occasion", "deny", "photo", "part", "Pinacoteca", "episode", "comedy", "David", "Trueba", "form", "chapter", "documentary", "narrate", "adventure", "mock", "plot", "release", "March", "Movistar", "change", "life", "aim", "reveal", "artist", "writers", "tone", "humour", "respond", "versions", "Art", "gallery", "matter", "wax", "twitter", "wits", "compare", "things", "Ecce", "Homo", "town", "Borja"], "adjective_words": ["social", "due", "next", "liken", "decide", "little", "large", "gray", "enough", "buxom", "become", "pass", "special", "false", "wax", "unwise", "clear", "controversial", "present", "statue", "hilarious", "famous"], "conjunction_words": ["And", "six"], "verb_words": ["disclose", "happen", "wax", "become", "generate", "receive", "statue", "appear", "go", "take", "explain", "episodes", "scenes", "turn", "opt", "produce", "redrawn", "carry"], "noun_phrases_words": ["figure Jorge Sanz Wax Museum Madrid horrify network Madrid museum", "prop series", "Jorge Sanz", "Thursday actor Jorge Sanz", "Museum Madrid", "trend social network due photograph actor next statue create image liken Madrid Wax Museum", "controversy statues personalities Fernando Alonso Rafael Nadal", "background users social network decide get humor ingenuity mess figure", "little actor Madrid Museum Wax Madrid", "large number criticisms", "Qu", "little nothing Sanz image actor", "next figure bulge eye gray suit", "buxom figure", "occasion nothing become trend", "Museum Madrid", "pass deny figure", "photo", "Madrid Museum image part", "Pinacoteca prop special episode series", "Jorge Sanz comedy create David Trueba form", "special chapter false documentary narrate adventure actor Madrid mock", "plot special chapter release March Movistar narrate change life actor Madrid", "Sanz", "wax museum aim reveal statue", "unwise figure artist writers", "clear tone humour", "figure little actor respond controversial unwise versions personalities present Art gallery matter social network wax figure", "statue wax museum Madrid twitter users", "wits", "hilarious versions", "figure compare", "things famous Ecce Homo town Borja"], "title_positive_words": [], "title_negative_words": ["horrify"], "title_common_noun_words": ["figure", "Jorge", "Sanz", "Wax", "Museum", "Madrid", "horrify", "network"], "title_adjective_words": [], "title_conjunction_words": [], "title_noun_phrases_words": ["figure Jorge Sanz Wax Museum Madrid horrify network"], "fake": true}, {"all_word": ["priest", "two", "supportive", "nuns", "support", "Vistalegre", "Pablo", "Iglesias", "We", "believe", "strong", "government", "direct", "image", "liken", "Government", "God", "benevolent", "father", "love", "people", "time", "severe", "priest", "expect", "two", "sympathetic", "nuns", "approach", "square", "Vistalegre", "show", "support", "Pablo", "Iglesias", "citizens", "Assembly", "Purple", "Formation", "want", "leader", "strong", "time", "benevolent", "also", "want", "Lord", "guide", "sister", "Paloma", "come", "Our", "Lady", "Europe", "Parish", "Madrid", "add", "We", "believe", "church", "believe", "church", "find", "fascinate", "verdaderametne", "see", "youth", "move", "concern", "change", "world", "great", "dream"], "all_joined": "                                \"We believe in a strong government, directed to the image and likeness of the Government of God, who is a benevolent father who loves the people but at the same time is severe.\" That is what the priest expects and the two sympathetic nuns of we can who have approached the square of Vistalegre to show their support to Pablo Iglesias during the citizens ' Assembly of the Purple Formation.

Festival of the Luminaries, is one of the most joyful festivities of Judaism. It evokes the prodigy that, according to the Hebrew tradition, occurred in the 2nd century before our era when the Macabes, after recovering in combat the Second Temple of Jerusalem, that the Hellenes had desecrated, they realized that there was not enough pure oil to Keep the ritual chandelier on. They found a vase, but it wasn't enough. Miraculously, the flames lit with that scarce oil burned for eight days. To remember it, the Jews ignite at this time the Januquiá, a candlestick of nine arms: one by day of the Miracle, and a ninth central, higher, for the candle with which the others light.-For the past three years, the international Claims Conference, which manages Jewish claims to Germany for Nazi crimes, brings together Holocaust survivors (or Shoah) to celebrate this party. Last Tuesday, third night of Hanukkah, was made in Berlin, Jerusalem, New York, and Moscow. Its drivers want to honor the witnesses who suffered the Holocaust (it is estimated that there could be about 500,000 around the world), and show that they are still present in society, often working as an alert to the anti-Semitism that resurfaces.-\"When we talk about the miracle of Hanukkah, I would like to say that many of you are here today because you survived the Shoah by a miracle,\" said Rüdiger Mahlo, representative of the claims Conference, to 300 survivors gathered at the Jewish community headquarters in Berlin. There was a jovial atmosphere of elderly people, sitting at long tables tasting fried delicacies in oil, typical of Hanukkah. But those same people – who were moved and touched by the kippah, with prom dresses and sequins – suffered 80 years ago from Nazi persecution, watched family and friends die, and lost their heritage.-\"Fewer survivors remain, often very old and poorly health, sometimes because of what they suffered; But many, thank God, are still in a position to report on what happened to them in Nazism, they go to schools, to universities... \", explains in a separate Charlotte Knobloch, of 86 years, president of the Jewish community of Munich and Upper Bavaria, which then ignited the Januquiá with other contemporaries.-She, born in a wealthy Munich family, was a girl in Hitler's time and was saved from the death hidden in the farm of a Catholic family. \"I discovered National Socialism when I was 4 years old, they forbade us to play with non-Jewish children. In 1938, in the Kristallnacht, I was on the street with my father, I saw the synagogue burning, the shops shattered, how the police took the Jews... \"-In 1942, his divorced father managed to send her to the field, to the farm of a former employee of her uncle's home, who made Charlotte pass by her maiden daughter. He lived there until the end of the war. \"My father was in forced labor, but when they were going to deport him, he managed to hide, and he survived,\" he explains. Her grandmother died in 1944 in the Theresienstadt camp.-In the early 1980s, Charlotte Knobloch began working on the care of Holocaust survivors, many of them with atrocious experiences of suffering. \"Even then there were many elderly people alone, they didn't have a family member, and I dedicated myself to that social work, where I have continued,\" he says.-\"It is now a matter of ensuring that the remaining survivors around the world have a comfortable life; I do not say a beautiful life, I say comfortable, \"he continues very earnestly, while in the adjoining hall the celebration of Hanukkah is at its apogee. The claims Conference, founded in 1951, negotiates and distributes compensations to survivors paid by the German government, both direct payments to individuals as well as to geriatric care institutions, food aid, and social programs.-\"I am concerned about the political situation in Germany and Europe, anti-Semitism and hatred of Israel all over the world,\" concludes Charlotte Knobloch.

Everything remains unusable until the patrimony is catalogued and estimated to divide it among the four heirs.-Who has come before the courts is Carlo Torlonia, the firstborn of Prince Alessandro, who denounces that his brothers Paola, Francesca and Giulio took him away from his father in the last years of life to stay with the inheritance.-According to his lawyer, Adriana Boscagli, only after the death of Alessandro Tornolia Carlo discovered \"the letters of the disease, current accounts closed shortly before death, closed boxes and ready to be sent elsewhere.\" He also alleges that the brothers met without telling them and that there were donations to them, including the Palazzo Torlonia, in the terminal phase of the disease.-The will in question is November 2016, a time when, according to the firstborn, \"was unable to contact the father or only by telephone communications, which were filtered by the elder sister or his secretary, who said he was in an optimal State of health. \" Carlo Torlonia assures that he learned from the press of the creation of the Torlonia Foundation, created in 2014 to manage all the art collections. \"Neither I nor my children had any role in it,\" protests the firstborn, who also denounces that his brothers have tried to move sculptures abroad. From what they denounce, they could have wanted to sell the large collection of marbles in an agreement between the foundation, the Paul Getty Museum of Malibu and the government for a recapitalization operation of the Fucino, family owned banking. For the judge, since the goods are of a historical value and there is evidence of the offer, the judicial kidnapping \"is the ideal element to ensure the full conservation of the patrimony\" until a final decision.-In a statement, the other brothers claim that they have never wanted to use any work of art as collateral for the Fucino's banking or recapitalization and ensure that they will appeal the judge's decision. \"There is no risk of dispersal of the artistic patrimony of the Torlonia family because the more than 620 works of art are all catalogued and linked and therefore are not exportable, not even temporarily, without the prior authorization\" of the Ministry of Italian culture, they explain.-According to Claudio Rendera in the great families of Rome, the history of the Torlonia family dates back to a Frenchman, Benedetto Tourlonias from Puy-de-Dôme, father of Marino Torlonia, who moved to Rome in 1750. His son, Giovanni, made his career as an agent of the German banker Fürsterberg and during the French domination of Rome he achieved the favour of the Bonaparte family and the pontifical aristocracy. It became so rich that it bought sumptuous properties and nobility titles. One of his heirs, Leopoldo, became mayor of Rome in the late nineteenth century. It is one of the few Italian aristocratic families who survived the reconstruction of the papal Court in 1969, and still today have the hereditary honor of being princes attending the papal throne. His fame and wealth is so well known that poems have even been written about it. But now everything could be questioned by a family feud.

whose murder is entered in prison awaiting trial José Enrique Abuín, alias ' The gum '.-According to the regional daily ' El Norte de Castilla ', sexual aggression would have occurred when Valeria was still under age. The complaint is filed against a friend of Valeria. According to the investigation, this boy traveled from Madrid to the province of Segovia accompanied by Valeria. At a certain point, he would have stopped the car in a place located about 65 kilometers from the capital of Segovia, where the rape allegedly would have occurred.-The events took place more than a year ago, as explained to the journalists the government delegate in Castilla y León, Virgina Barcoes, who has added that the police investigation is held in Madrid, where the complaint was filed.-Sources of TSJCyL have explained that the complaint of sexual assault was presented against a young man in Pozuelo de Alarcón (Madrid). Having allegedly taken place in the Sepúlveda judicial party, a question of competition was finally resolved in favour of the Segoviano court. -At present, the procedure is under investigation and, due to the compulsory protection of privacy and the nature of the crime under investigation, the court will not offer any further information, the TSJCyL has indicated.-The instructor of the Court of First instance and instruction that takes the case has ordered the staff's discretion to avoid leaks that precipitate an \"unwanted\" media avalanche, as occurred recently with the case of the woman condemned by Exalting through Facebook the death of the bullfighter Victor Barrio. -However, sources of Diana Quer's family have reported that the news about the alleged sexual assault on Valeria Quer \"does not conform to reality\" and have called for \"respect for her right to privacy.\"-The 18-year-old Diana Quer, older sister of Valeria, disappeared in August 2016 in Puebla do Carmiñal (A Coruña) and her corpse was found on December 31, 2017, murder for which will be judged José Enrique Abuín, alias the chewing gum.-The family spokesman has pointed out that \"once again\" they appeal

defended the Basque 'via' to update and deepen the self-government 'in the framework of a renewed coexistence Pact' and does not believe that, for this reason, it is accurate, necessarily, a constitutional reform.-   He has also urged 'don't demonize in advance' the agreement of bases of the new statute agreed with EH Bildu and the PNV because still ' there are tour ' and his desire is to 'widen' the consensus, so it has appealed to 'not to frighten more than it should'.-   Within the framework of the Forum of economic expectations, held in Bilbao, Urkullu said be living 'HV declarative' times in the political arena but wanted to value the initiatives and agreements in the area of institutional and political.-   In this regard, it referred to the agreement in July last year with the central Government to the updating of the economic agreement and the settlement of the pending quota since 2007.-   Secondly, it has highlighted the 'unanimous support institutional, political and social' received by the economic agreement on the occasion of its 140th Anniversary. 'It is us to strengthen this support, sharing the pride of our uniqueness and commitment to manage it properly', noted.-   The third point which has hinted is the meeting of the Joint Commission of transfers on November 26, the first from 2011, which became certified three agreements on railway and highway, and underlined the commitment of the central Government of present and agree on a 'schedule and a work plan for the full implementation of the Statute of Gernika'.-   ' This is substantial; advancing real and positive for both parties, we have achieved in the field of the economic agreement and the Basque self-government ', added.-   In his view, these advances exemplify the 'Basque' via which the Basque Government is going to give 'continuity'. ' It is my commitment as President and it is necessary to apply a dose of 'realism, rigor and responsibility', has secured.-   In this sense, in the first place has made reference to assume the 'necessary clarification of competences', expand the competence Fund of Euskadi and agreed 'an effective bilaterally and with guarantees, system that facilitates the implementation of the agreements'. In this regard, considers the economic agreement 'a useful reference and eficaz model'.-   Urkullu has defended that meet the Gernika Statute or 'engage' in compliance 'it would alleviate many concerns' that may exist and have wondered, if it fails, 'other options are'. In his view, 'first thing is comply with the Statute'.-   On the other hand, has defended the assumption of the plurinational State reality. In this sense, it has ensured that in Basque country and Catalonia have shown 'a social wills clearly differentiated to the State'.-   In his view, it is necessary to go in a new model of relations with the State in the current context of ' a new Europe more committed to the principles of subsidiarity and multilevel governance and shared sovereignty '.-   'The Basque model settled in the methodology, with a different sense of national belonging and a confederal quasi interinstitutional reality is a useful and effective reference', he stressed.-   It also believes that we must assume that progress in deepening and Basque self-government update ' does not, necessarily require, a constitutional reform'. Urkullu has ensured that, if there were a constitutional reform, it should 'look to the new rights that exist in society, to the European reality which does not provide for the Constitution, to what may be a reform of the Constitutional Court'.-   'In the same way that we can imagine the need for reforms, also you can think of the need for an adaptation of the Statute of autonomy of Guernica to the current reality', said Urkullu.-   The President has argued that the Constitution, which, as he recalled, Thursday celebrates 40 years, 'protects and respects the historical rights', i.e. 'the singularity of Basque self-government'.-   ' I raised a constitutional Convention. In 1981 it was launched the LOAPA and, although it declared unconstitutional, led to a restrictive practice of singular autonomy, which if applied. I am now raising a positive 'Convention' which promotes updating and deepening of self-government in the framework of a renewed coexistence Pact. It is a reference that can be useful and effective ', has secured.-   In relation to the agreement of foundations for the new statute agreed by PNV and EH Bildu, and wondered if there may be a shift in alliances by the jeltzales, said that it can not respond by the PNV and it has framed the agreements in the ' exercise of m policy anera responsible '.-   In this sense, has denounced the 'demonization in advance' bases agreement closed between 'legal parties' when still is 'subject to discussion' and there is a 'desire' to 'widen' and expand that agreement. In his view, it is being 'the cart before the horse'.-   Therefore, Urkullu has ensured that there is 'travel' to 'final stage' and asked 'not to frighten more than it should'. Therefore he has asked to be 'fair' with the times and 'honest' with the procedure.-   Finally, emphasised that 'solid foundation' have been built to face the future and the autonomous Executive is a coalition Government 'two different parties working together on a common agenda, without fanfare and without tension'.-   ' This is our virtue. Our commitment is to continue to ensure stability and seriousness in the management, focusing on a job well done every day, together to develop projects that will allow to move us. We will continue focusing on making.

no ambiguity in the results: Ambulances are direct and repeated targets in Syria,\" said Hayes Wong, one of the authors of the report.-The attacks investigated were mainly in opposition-controlled enclaves in and around Aleppo, Idlib and Damascus, and about 90 per cent were carried out by Syrian government forces and Russian allies, according to the investigation.-Several reports of attacks on health workers and healthcare centres have been published during the eight-year conflict in Syria, although both are protected by international law.-Among the most prominent medical workers in Syria are the rescue workers of the White Helmets.-Syrian President Bashar al-Assad accuses the group of acting as propaganda tools and representatives of Islamist-led insurgents.-According to the investigation, paramedics in ambulances are particularly vulnerable to attacks, as they are quite visible and can be attacked when they serve the victims after an attack.-Almost half of the ambulances that were attacked suffered severe damage or even ended up being destroyed, something that could hinder efforts to help the victims, according to the investigators.-The document has also highlighted the use of attacks in which an area is bombarded twice in a short period of time, with the aim of attacking emergency workers when responding to the first attack.-The World Health Organization (WHO) has indicated that the report highlights the dangers of health workers in Syria.-\"Who reiterates its call on all parties to the Syrian conflict to remember their humanity, fulfil their obligations under international humanitarian law and respect the sanctity and safety of facilities and health workers\", has assured the Who spokesperson Traik Jasarevic.-Who has reported that in the year 97

And we are not talking exclusively about sports-related bets, also of course others located in the game world, such is the case of for example online casinos or the much-demanded poker. The unstoppable boom of new technologies in this 21st century is encouraging many to opt to gamble and have fun on the internet rather than go to the usual casinos of life.-This contributes notably to the fact that the number of bettors has not stopped growing these years ago, many of them covered in the generalization of the betting players. That is why the physical casinos do not go through an especially benign situation. The unstoppable future of online gambling has placed them in a somewhat complicated and difficult to confront. This is a challenge that these classic recreational establishments must undertake to re-engage a client that is increasingly happy to play on the net.-Focusing briefly on the particular case of sports betting, today, in our country, football is still the king. One of the reasons why online gaming is acquiring progressively more adepts is the ubiquitous advertising of bookmaker portals consumed in almost any sport-related event.-In the case of the major European football championships, their strength lies in the fact that they are a great showcase for these operators to be able to project themselves on an international scale. The Premier League, our Spanish league and the Calcio (Italy) are the three domestic competitions that more money and gamblers move in this sport king. Of course the portals of the game are aware of this fact. Not in vain, it is in this sport where more types of different offers are proposed to the player. -The traditional 1X2 have been incorporated in the last few different modalities, as which player will open the score, or the total number of goals to be scored in a match, to expose a couple of simple cases of the many that can participate... All these great sporting events, for their constitution and development, favor live betting. -During the first six months of this year, they moved a figure of 1.821 billion euros, which is 30% more than the previous period. This amount represents 70% of the total monetary amount generated by the sports betting in the first semester that vertebrae the year. It is one of the many hopeful data that the reports on this sector are raising. ", "title_word": ["sports", "bet", "hit", "record"], "subtitle_word": ["year", "remember", "among", "many", "things", "consecration", "online", "bet", "sport", "particular",

Christopher Columbus, erected 45 years ago in the Grand Park of the center of the North American city, as part of a motion Passed last year that has already replaced the old \"Discovery Day\" with \"the day of the indigenous peoples\". -A message that traced some of the mantras of populism, Latin American or Spanish, symbolized in leaders such as the Bolivian Evo Morales or, already in Spain, the deputy of ERC Gabriel Ruffian, who did not hesitate to refer to the day of the Hispanic, consecrated precisely to Discovery, as \"genocide.\"-\"The statue of Christopher Columbus rewrites a stained chapter of history that charges false romanticism the expansion of European empires and exploitations of natural resources and human beings,\" according to the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and current Member of the city's governing board, Hilda Solis, author of the unusual motion.-\"Thus, the removal of the Columbus statue in Grand Park is an act of restorative justice that honors and embraces the resilient spirit of the original inhabitants of our county. With his removal, we begin a new chapter in our history in which we learn from past mistakes so that we are no longer condemned to repeat them, \"he said in statements collected by the NBC network.-For city Councillor Mitch O'Farrell, the removal of the statue is a \"natural step in the advances to eliminate the false narrative that Columbus discovered America.\" \"In addition, Columbus himself was responsible for genocide and his actions contributed to the greatest genocide ever recorded. His image is not to be held anywhere, \"added O'Farrell, a member of the Wyandot Nation of American Indians.-There is no official protest from Spain, a country that also has attacks on the figure of Columbus from the independence or from can and the most radical left, usually critical of the figure of the Discoverer and the great feat of 1492 that led to America the Civilization, the law and the University.-Italian protests-Councilman Joe Buscaino, of Italian descent, expressed reservations about the cancellation of Columbus Day and tried to make an unsuccessful effort to get the motion withdrawn. \"With or without Columbus, the Italians will continue to celebrate their sacrifices and contributions to this great country and our great city,\" said Buscaino.-The surprising thing about this decision is that it seems more typical of other countries such as Chávez Venezuela which, in 2004, consented to the violent demolition of the statue of Columbus that presided over the Plaza de

stretch. It seems like yesterday when it tore off this tenth edition of 'Idol', but now there are only six contestants in the 'talent show' musical reference of Spanish Television. «What inches, my God! ', said starting the gala presenter Leal Roberto. Marta, who had three weeks in a row among the nominees, abandoned Wednesday «OT 2018» Academy and left to Natalia, Famous, Alba Reche, Sabela, Miki and Julia as only members of the same. The first two, in fact, already are finalists in the program thanks to the will of the jury and the professors, while the other three members of the final will come out of the next gala, according to ABC.-The contest changed his mechanics in its 11 Gala, so after the performances the four members of the jury assessed each applicant and the sum of the scores, came out the first finalist of «OT 2018». And it was clear the jury: that wasn't other than Natalia Lacunza, which seems willing to take witness Amaia Romero in the last edition and to revalidate his sceptre. As it happened last year with Amaia, Natalia took four tens of the jury and became the first to cross the footbridge. Back left Alba Reche and Julia, tied to 37 points; Famous with 35; Sabela with 33 and Miki with 31.-The second finalist, chosen by the Academy, was Famous. «You are 'Idol'», said Noemí Galera, until young, excited, crossed the runway. The other three contestants who will compete for the final prize of the contest will be the next Gala. The first returns it to choose the jury, while the public will be that choose the other two. Natalia and Famous already in the final, Alba Reche, Sabela, Miki and Julia will fight to join them in the next 12 Gala.-Although returning to this eleventh evening of competition, contestants began overnight to the rhythm of «Neither you nor nobody», the timeless theme of Alaska y Dinarama who made Leal to remember that it's been almost three months since that 0 Gala. «Thousand bells ring in my heart. What difficult is to say goodbye!», said the driver of the program, which covered the letter your way to start a Gala 11 of «OT 2018', which also featured two guest artists: Rosana and the finalist of «OT 2017» Alfred García.-After the group performance, Marta, who was the voice of George Michael to give everything with 'One more try' and say goodbye to overhand took the stage: with their best performance in the entire contest. Does not say it which sign this, but Joe Pérez-Orive, juror and that not only assessed with those words to Marta, but that was beyond. 'It's the best cover that have never made to George Michael,' said Perez-orive about the unfortunate singer.-Not stayed behind Sabela, which shone on the stage with a new record: salsa the rhythm of 'Quarter of the Tula', of Buena Vista Social Club. A theme that showed the evolution of the young in competition so far. Also says that he is writing this piece, but it came out of the mouth of the boyfriend of the applicant, Chus, who visited Sabela after his performance in dish. ' A few weeks ago, never would have seen you doing these actions ', valued the young man. Visit the boy, all told, was applauded by the audience on social networks, which did not cease to compare him with the boyfriend of Mary, present in the program last week and that starred in one of the more surreal Edition. «Differences between a decent boyfriend and a homo erectus», came to express the viewers on Twitter. Little to add.-The truth is that the growth of Sabela since it started the program has been more than notorious. «When you can, look and then today the first finery Sabela», called upon the young Perez-orive. It is not for less. Galician singer took 64 percent of the public support and will fight next Wednesday for entering the end of «OT 2017».-Famous, the third to take the baton, returned to look again. The young increasingly enjoys more onstage and what is best, not to do enjoy the audience with their performances. On this occasion, it shone with «Problem», Ariana Grande. ' You go to the stage and is that you become. Feel it ', Manuel Martos evaluated him. A declaration of intent, which ended by excite to an applicant that is increasingly more candidate to win in «OT 2018». 'You're the diamond in the rough of this Edition,' initialled Martos. «I'll tell in two words: Famous Eurovision», stressed Perez-Orive.Julia, Sabela and Alba Reche, radiant-Julia, who did not want to be outdone, tried to shine with a new record with «Sober», for Demi Lovato, which managed to fascinate. ' I've noticed that these weeks I've been very picky about it, but I have been because I fully trust you and your music career', evaluated Perez-orive. Less triumphant was Miki, who failed to approach the level of his fellow with children of the Earth, of Nil Moliner. A theme «festivo-alegre», as Martos welcomed it, but that did not end thrill to the jury or to «OT 2018» public and he did finish the night as the candidate less voted by the jury.-The contest left for the final two of their big favorite: Natalia and Alba Reche. The first was one night with 'Bang Bang'. A tribute to Nancy Sinatra and the soundtrack of 'Kill Bill', the fourth film from Quentin Tarantino. «Has left us speechless, to us and to all Spain», evaluated Javier Llanos, invited Member of the jury at this Gala 11. 'I have to ask you that you spend your whole life singing,' required you Perez-orive the first finalist of «OT 2018».-Alba, for his part, dared with ' Crazy in love', Beyonce, with a performance that was fascinated by Ana Belén, substitute of Ana Torroja this Wednesday and that didn't hide his admiration for the young. «What barbaro! You're a great artist, who risks much. «But it is always better to repent of something you've done that not having it done», said Ana Belén. «You one of those singers who, when he begins to sing, we know who is singing», commented Martos. 'The risk is not risk, and sometimes have to do to do what you do', said Perez-orive.

The idea is to send the plastic, once picked up, to a recycling company.\nRevolutionary system The difference between this system and others that have been previously tested is that, at other times, the method was to try to fish the plastic from a ship, ways that were criticized for being also polluting, expensive and inefficient, because it It figures it would take almost 80,000 years to clean up the entire ocean. The floating barriers also have cons, among which are found that they can only recover the garbage from the surface, which represents a small percentage of the total.\n\nHowever, if its usefulness is determined, the system could be fully deployed in 2020, and it is estimated that in a decade it could collect almost half of the plastic of the so-called great garbage stain of the Pacific.\nIn Morocco or bags will be manufactured in the meantime, countries put dissuasive measures of the use of plastic bags. Among the most recent, that of Morocco, which from today, 1 July, prohibits the manufacture, import, export, commercialization and use of plastic bags. Marrakech will host the COP22 climate summit and the Moroccan Government has promoted a \"zero bag\" campaign, where several celebrities pose with wicker baskets and cloth

rising again, as a clear indicator that Criptomoneda enjoys better health than ever. We can say that the health of Bitcoin is at a good time, as it has been able to recover smoothly from the ups and downs it had suffered during 2017. We have to bear in mind that during the 2017 the Bitcoin reached a really spectacular price, in the month of December it reached a price close to the 20,000 USD, and nevertheless in January 2017 the price was only close to the 1000 USD. This vertiginous evolution that the Bitcoin suffered during 2017, managed to propitiate some destabilization in the Criptomoneda, which today has already managed to get rid of, thanks to a sensible evolution that today places its valuation close to the 8200 USD. \n            if (window. innerWidth < = 650) {document. write (\"< div id = ' DFP-Steal-1 ' class = ' banner banner-R ' data-banner = ' Steal-1 ' data-size = ' mobile ' > <script> googletag. cmd. push (function () {Googletag.

We have to take into account that even though today the world of the Criptomonedas has evolved a lot, and there are many Criptomonedas, with Bitcoin started everything, and that is why it is important to try to understand what happens with the original Criptomoneda. It is important to note that it is not necessary to have technical knowledge to understand what the Criptomonedas are and how the Bitcoin works.\nWhat happened to the Bitcoin?\nThe Bitcoin has hoarded unprecedented popularity in recent years, mainly due to the impressive rise in its valuation during the year 2017. As previously discussed, and to put in context, on January 1, 2017, the Bitcoin price was close to 1000 USD, however, at the end of the year, in December 2017, the price was around 20,000 USD, a spectacular rise for just a Period of one year. It is impossible to compare this impressive rise in the Bitcoin with any other type of financial asset.\nWhat happened was that the Bitcoin went down to lows close to 5800 USD last June, and yet today it is recovering by reaching approximately 8200 USD. Although it may seem that there is a very exaggerated fluctuation, the truth is that during this year Bitcoin is keeping quite stable, without growths as pronounced as those that were experienced in 2017, and that began to be really impressive to From November 2017. \n            if (window. innerWidth < = 650) {document. write (\"< div id = ' DFP-Steal-2 ' class = ' banner banner-R ' data-banner = ' Steal-2 ' data-size = ' mobile ' > <script> googletag. cmd. push (function () {Googletag.

Many self-proclaimed finance gurus had predicted that this was the end of Bitcoin, and nothing farther from reality. More and more people are betting on making transactions with Bitcoin, or using Bitcoin as an investment tool. While it is true that it has high volatility, it is also true that all financial assets have a high volatility. Bitcoin is something new, which is logically exposed to aggressive speculative behaviors, such as those that it suffered during 2017, but of which it has certainly come out gracefully and ready to

of the Audiencia Nacional, which investigated the alleged irregular financing of the PP, José de la Mata, cited to testify on December 21 at 10.00 hours to PP Luis Bárcenas extesorero and his wife Rosalía Iglesias, for the so-called sensitive information about the party that would have been removed in the so-called operation Kitchen.-At the same time, the magistrate refuses, as he asked the accusation that exerts the Association Observatori de Drets Humans (DESC), convene at the moment legal domicile to the former Secretary general of the PP Maria Dolores de Cospedal and her husband, Ignacio Lopez of el Hierro, who they were recorded by the retired Commissioner José Manuel Villarejo in a conversation with him in which seemed to make him a custom.-In a car, the owner of the Central Court of instruction number 5 agrees to a series of proceedings with respect to their investigation into a so-called 'case B' in the PP from the documents that has delivered it the newspaper 'El Mundo', which has been publishing in the year 201 3 was launched on a police operation financed with funds reserved for information Bárcenas would have led the party when was dismissed.-Among these documents, explains De la Mata, consist 'assumptions manuscripts' Rosalía Iglesias, 'anotaciones de Barcenas' and ' others referred to income and expenses of the PP other all to the contributed ' by the extesorero 'popular' in the year 2013, when they came to light the so-called B payments to party leaders.-The first time with all kills this 'advised' summon Bárcenas and his wife, both in quality of investigated. The extesorero has been accused in this case since that year, but given the circumstance that will be the first time that pay statement to la Mata, since the last time that made him was former judge instructor, Pablo Ruz. For his part, churches will appear for the first time in this investigation, although it has already been imputed (and doomed) in another part of the case Gürtel.-Similarly, the judge agrees to send all the documentation provided by 'El Mundo' so parse its contents and to relate it to the rest of the information that is at work in the cause, i.e. with the known to police investigators ' roles of Barcenas', notes on the income and payments in B of the PP.-Since the operation' Kitchen' is an investigation that left the Central investigating court number 6, asks this body to give service of all documents available on the police operation in which they were allegedly involved the Commissioners José Manuel Villarejo and Enrique García Castaño, operating that would have captured the driver of the extesorero so he stole her documents.-And to gather all available information, De la Mata returns to ask the Secretary of State of security of the Ministry of the Interior to send him 'of immediate mode' the 'full report' which already asked about all the data which is available from the ' operation Kitchen'. Once again, the judge insists that he wants to know 'the identities of all persons who have participated in this and past perpetrators, expression of their tasks and responsibilities'.-The report, continues the judge, ' it must be accompanied by all the generated documentation obtained during its development and/or ', everything that is not directly affected by the party who could be affected by laws of official secrets and reserved expenditure, to the time that you will ask, 'in a separate resolution', the declassification of the entire operation.-However, this request already was issued two weeks ago by the judge of reinforcement of the Central Court of instruction number 6, and the Vice-President of the Government, Camen Calvo, announced that the Council of Ministers will approve the declassification of all operation this same Friday.-On the other hand, the judge investigating the case' B' denied the request of the DESC accusation (represented by the also Attorney Carles Puigdemont, Gonzalo Boye) cited as witnesses to Cospedal and Lopez of el Hierro and to require the portal Moncloa.com the digital media conversation both with Villarejo, always at the moment and without prejudice to the outcome of the investigation of the cause.-The judge argues that 'apparently such talks, which would have taken place in 2009, would be related to obtaining information reserved on other criminal procedure and hinder processing', i.e., 'Tandem operation', which investigates the work supposedly performed by Villarejo for certain clients on an irregular basis.",

The campaign for the Andalusian elections next Sunday, December 2, which will give way to the XI Legislature, has come this Friday night to an end with all parties appealing to a massive mobilization to achieve continuity or change after 36 years of Socialist government. With a PSOE to which all the polls predicts winner of the elections, the margin that obtains on its immediate competitor can be decisive to continue or not to govern to a potential sum of PP, Cs and even Vox, that some see possible. The uncertainty is in a fork of 4-5 seats that could tilt the balance in one direction or another, with its consequences in a national key reading.-The campaign began with a low pulse by the PSOE, who all the polls already gave as a winner and aspired to look at his right (Cs) and left (forward Andalusia) in what Susana Diaz defined as \"broadband government.\" He visited more villages than any other candidate, kissed more ladies than anyone, but the tone of his speech was far from the emotional connection of other occasions; A strategy, say their own, to get out of the tension that brought other formations.-In front of it were the parties of the \"blockade\", as the Socialist president and candidate for the re-election called it: Forward Andalusia, coalition to which it hardly mentioned and which defended that for the first time there was an alternative of change to the left of the PSOE, and the Block on the right, more concerned about his own fight for a second since he would guarantee or settle his role on the national stage for the future. In fact, both PP and Cs counted on the prominence of their top leaders, Pablo Casado and Albert Rivera, who did not hesitate to raise the Andalusian appointment as a first round of the general election and ended up polluting the regional debate with the management of Catalan theme, as appreciated in the two debates to four televised.-But the fragmentation of the conservative bloc has not only made the message more to the right, to the chagrin of the regional leaders of the PP, but it has given rise to the emergence of a new actor, Vox, who even the pre-electoral survey of the CIS opened its entry into the P Regional Arlamento. The popular have recognized that there are some of their disgruntled voters, who previously only escaped Cs, and have not hesitated to wink or recognize without ambages that, if they achieve parliamentary representation, will count on them to evict the PSOE and get The long-awaited change after 36 years.-Adelante Andalucía is confident that the fragmentation of the right is such that it will end up penalizing these parties when adding the seats that come to the parties with the system of remains. The beneficiaries, they assure, will be them, but also the PSOE, as yesterday conceded the married one. \"For a few tenths of a vote, the last seats granted in each province can give a change or continuity,\" he insisted, appealing to the useful vote to his party not to lose those remains.-In the socialist ranks, the alarms have been turned on, because less than 42 seats would complicate matters to Diaz; That is why it was the candidate who in recent days has been responsible for shaking the ghost of a government \"xenophobic and sexist\" with Vox, and not stop seeking a massive mobilization. His fear is that the less-excited socialist voter ends up staying at home because he knows his team will win. Hence his calls to militancy to go door to door to \"win, but win well.\" Moreover, after a few moments reluctant to pollute the Andalusian discourse, it has ended up recognizing that its victory in Andalusia will serve as a \"dike of containment on the right\" and facilitate the PSOE win \"with a larger majority\" in the generals and therefore continue Ruling. However, many among the Socialists do not hide that to bring to mind Vox could be a play of \"risk\" by encouraging the vote ultraconservative, making the rights to add and prevent the PSOE to reach the four decades in front of the Junta de Andalucía.", "title_word": ["andalusia", "close", "combative", "campaign"], "subtitle_word": ["party", "agitate", "two", "extreme", "block", "government",

"King Juan Carlos will come on Thursday, Day 6, to the Congress, where the Solemn act for the 40 anniversary of the Constitution is to be held. The detail was known this Friday at noon, when the Zarzuela made public the agenda of the week. The head of state, however, did not want to inform where the former monarch will be placed in the parliamentary scenography. Felipe and Letizia will preside over a ceremony attended by Queen Sofia, senators, former presidents and speakers of the Fundamental law. The current head of State shall make a speech, like the President of Congress, Ana Pastor. Juan Carlos will not, at least within the Hemicycle, added Fuentes de la Zarzuela.-Among the different places that can occupy in the lower house is included the guest tribune; The centre of the Hemicycle, where the stenographers are usually placed, and the Presidency, together with the Kings. Parliamentary sources clarified that the decision will be taken by Zarzuela even if the Congress give more information from Monday. A punctualization to anticipate possible problems, like the one that lived the two institutions last year, when Juan Carlos did not participate in the celebration of the first democratic elections also in the Congress. The old monarch made his anger known and the House of the king was accused of that absence. -Now, before the main week of the constitutional celebrations, the Zarzuela has decided to compensate that episode and Juan Carlos, in addition to going to the Congress, will also participate in the audience to the Advisory Council of the Monday Cortes General and at the inauguration of ' Democracy 1978-2018 ' at the CaixaForum, on Tuesday.-Juan Carlos ' attendance at the Congress Act was unclear. Some episodes have complicated what should have been the natural fit of the King Emeritus in the memory of that historical stage, in which he played a key role. The head of the state takes five months off the official agenda due to health problems and also to recordings in which his exfriend Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein said, among other things, that the monarch Emeritus had obtained a commission by the bird to Mecca. The national hearing considered the signs \"extremely weak\" and closed the case. -To the controversy over this shelve was added another controversy last week, when the former head of state appeared in the GP of Formula 1 of Abu Dhabi, where he greeted the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohamed bin Salman, to which the CIA considers the instigator of the murder of the journalist Jamal Jashoggi. The Zarzuela highlighted that it was a private agenda.", "title_word": ["king", "Juan", "Carlos", "participate", "homage", "Constitution", "Congress"], "subtitle_word": ["Zarzuela",

alleviate the precarious work between one of the groups most punished after the outbreak of the economic crisis: the young people. It was anticipated by Secretary of State for employment, Yolanda Valdeolivas, on Tuesday and confirmed by the president himself in a television interview on Wednesday. \"We have a clear roadmap and a clear social agenda. We are going to launch this same Friday with the youth employment plan. \"-This Plan of shock for the young employment 2019-2021 aims to combat the high figures of unemployment that still drags this group includes measures such as the hiring of 3,000 technicians for the labour insertion, the drafting of a statute for the non-working practices or A plan to repatriate that talent that he saw after the outbreak of the crisis that his future was abroad.-All these measures, collected in a document to which the newspaper has been accessed, will be financed with an amount of 2 billion euros for the next three years and have as main objective to reduce youth unemployment by about 10 points. The plan comes after discussing it at the Social dialogue tables with employers and unions. Despite the initial reluctance, entrepreneurs have ended up seconding the measure.-According to the latest data available from the 2018 third quarter active Population survey, the unemployment rate was up to three times higher among the youngest than the average unemployed. Discouragement, lack of opportunity or precariousness has also caused activity rates, i.e. availability and willingness to work, to have fallen by 10 years to 15 points.-The number of new technicians that the central government will finance in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities coincides with the cuts after the entry to the government of former president Mariano Rajoy and has been claimed by both the PSOE in opposition and the Unions. \"It is a first step, although to reach the ratios between the occupyer and user of the European average would be necessary 7,000 new technicians,\" says a trade union source.-The idea is that these counsellors enter into contracts for work and services of year and a half, without the written commitment of the government, according to sources present at the tables of Social dialogue, that later become a fixed template.-The idea of this measure is that the figure commonly known as \"scholar\" does not end up camouflaging a more working relationship than learning and stop hiring among the youngest. In this sense, sources consulted blame a lack of concretion in the plan.-This reform, partly inspired by the French model, will eliminate all those bonuses to training contracts. Something that also comes with the reduction of total unemployment up to a figure of about 15%. At the time, the government of the PP justified these bonuses due to high unemployment rates and, at a time of expansion of employment, the executive of Pedro Sanchez has decided to eliminate them.-According to data from the state Public Employment Service (SEPE) collected by CCOO in early 2018, in Spain there were one million university students in external practices, as well as 282,000 vocational training students, 63,000 unemployed people in Training for employment and 100,000 persons in the other three modalities of non-labour practices.-To ensure that none of these practices engage in fraud, the Ministry of Labour studies to extend the resources for inspection and enable inspectors to make extra hours focused on prosecution. A practice already used against temporary and partial unjustified hiring.-Another axis is to facilitate the return of young people migrated after the crisis. The instruments will be aid to the re-incorporation to the labor market, via subsidies to the self-employment or incentives for the companies when hiring. Also to pay back, as rent aid. ", "title_word": ["government", "approve", "plan", "youth", "unemployment", "new", "guidance"], "subtitle_word": ["public", "policy", "package", "endow", "billion",

"all_joined": "The number of specimens of northern Bettong, known in Australia as the \"Kangaroo rat\", does not exceed 2,500 copies and if not taken measures could disappear in 10 years, alerted on Wednesday the Global Fund for Nature (WWF).-\"We must protect the bettong that remain and restore forests, controlling pests and using recommended fire control plans to maintain and expand their habitat,\" said Tim Cronin, an Australian subsidiary of the Organization at A statement.-The Bettong of the North (Bettongia Tropica), a marsupial of the size of a hare that moves slowly jumping and which became endemic throughout Australia, currently occupies an area of 145 square kilometers in two places of the humid tropics of the state of Queensland, in northeastern Australia.-\"But it is known that only one of the populations is stable,\" said the report of the North Bettong Project published after an investigation that lasted five years.-According to the study, the Bettong of the north, whose population extended in an area of 1,000 square kilometres at the beginning of the European colonization of Australia, has an \"important and irreplaceable role in the ecosystem\".-The absence of the Northern Bettong would imply a reduction in the diversity of truffles and possibly damage to the diversity of the trees and the ecosystem in general, said this project in which also participated James Cook University, the traditional owners And authorities in Queensland and Australia.-It is estimated that the habitat of these marsupials was reduced to 355 square kilometers in the last three decades and that only the area called Lamb Range, southwest of the city of Cairns, seems to retain a relatively strong population.-\"The good news is that the tropical bettong is stable at the core of its habitat,\" said Sandra Abell, who managed the scientific project, whose projections suggest that the Lamb range population could disappear in 10 years if no measures are taken.-Abell warned that \"the current number, which probably does not exceed 2,500 (copies) is well below the 5,000-1000 specimens that was calculated when it was given the status of ' in jeopardy ' on the IUCN Red List (International Union for the Conservation of Nature) \".-One of the threats of the northern Bettong are the wild cats, one of their predators that was detected in 40 percent of the eleven areas analyzed, as well as livestock and wild pigs, competitors for food and that alter the habitat and availability of AL Imentos.-This is compounded by the impact of the reduction of indigenous fire-control regimes that help maintain forest health.-\"To make matters worse, climate change is likely to alter its habitat more by affecting the availability of seasonal food and exacerbating the threats of wildfires and wild predators,\" WWF said in the communiqué. ", "title_word": ["Australian", "marsupial", "rat", "near", "extinction"], "subtitle_word": ["marsupial", "important",

platform since next week, but also in other high-package modalities. Thus, old modalities of the merger category are expensive. Telefónica, of course, offers alternatives: complete services, improve catalogs. In short, move on to the company's new options launched in October. Who has football, is offered series... and vice versa. The company tries to monetize its trade agreements by encouraging its most complete convergent offers. On the one hand, it needs to put in value the disbursement made by sporting rights; From this Monday, to accommodate your agreement to integrate Netflix. -That television service will be available from next week and will be released on the 10th, in a media presentation. According to sources in this journal, it has worked with an integration in different levels of usability, with an interface on demand similar to the one that Netflix has established with Comcast in the USA and with Sky in the United Kingdom. If a user queries Movistar, it would have before Netflix, integrated the contents of this as part of the options available, both in a carousel and searches. It should not be forgotten that both Vodafone and Orange already gave place to Netflix, before Telefónica, on their respective television platforms.-Netflix rates are already known, even if they have not been reported yet. Telefónica uploaded them to the internet and were captured on different websites, such as Engadget. The resulting new packages are these:-The version for two simultaneous accounts. It is achieved with an increase of 10 euros at the price of Movistar fusion selection or Movistar Total merger (the latter would go up to 140 euros with Netflix). If the client has Total merge Plus, adding Netflix has a cost of $5 USD per month (los165). However, in these cases would be saved with respect to any parallel recruitment of Movistar and Netflix, as the options of this platform are the basic 8 euros, the standard 11 and premium 14. -The version for four simultaneous accounts on Netflix. The recruitment would increase by 13 euros The merger payments selection or by Total merger-this would grow to 143-. In the case of Total Fusion Plus, add 8 euros and the maximum is reached, the amount of 168 euros per month. -Apart from this agreement with the main World Service of streaming, Telefónica raises the price of the old high-end packages, with the door open to hire alternatives such as those that were launched last October. As of February 5, there is an increase of 5 euros that practically pushes the category jump.-Fusion + Total Football and fusion + total leisure. It increases from 125 to 130 euros. Therefore, a customer of this option could go through the same price from 130 to Total merger. If it was part of the base of clients of football, it would win Movistar Series and Movistar premieres, while it would get all the football if it was framed within the users of leisure. -Fusion + Premium. There is an increase of 5 euros, from 150 to 155 if you have two mobile lines and 175 to 180 if you have four. -It is noteworthy that Telefónica has recently uploaded prices on mobile, internet and fixed. It has come to the converged offers, although some prices are maintained:-Fusion # 0. The price is maintained and is invited to access the new portfolio, which has the merger mode 0, with the channel #Vamos and a lower price (55 euros versus 60)-Fusion Series. Nor is it increased and it is sought that the user enters in the football, by which Telefónica has made a strong disbursement: Fusion Base includes Movistar Partidazo, league and #Vamos for a price of 72 euros, by the 77 of fusion Series.-Fusion + Football and Fusion + leisure. They experience a rise of 5 euros. In this case we want to mobilize the client to merge selection, winning Series if he was a football client, and one of the two soccer options (the whole league or champions more Europa league) if he was a leisure client.

situation of the Spanish economy. The Minister of Economy, Nadia Calviño, again defended yesterday that Spain will meet the deficit targets and that the slowdown is less important than the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the European Commission estimates, did not hesitate to say that the salary Minimum Interprofessional (SMI) will not destroy jobs and even anticipated that there are good news in terms of debt because it will reduce up to 97% of gross domestic product (GDP) at the end of this exercise. -At the informative breakfast organized by Europa Press, the minister said that the economy is \"absolutely online to meet the deficit target of 2.7%\", and that if the government manages to pass the budgets the deviation in 2019 will be 1.8%. This would mean a nine-tenth reduction that neither the IMF nor the Commission believes possible, and Brussels has already warned that the executive's plan \"presents risks of non-compliance with the Stability Pact.\" But Calviño ignored all the warnings and just stressed that the OECD does consider the reduction feasible. -In terms of growth, the head of economy underlined the robust behavior of GDP, and converted the widespread decline that a few weeks ago the IMF, Brussels and the OECD itself carried out in a mere link to official forecasts. And as for the impact of the SMI, Calviño explained that the rise of the minimum wage to 900 euros agreed by the government and we can not have any negative consequence, something that not only contradicts what was pointed out by the independent authority of Fiscal responsibility ( AIReF) or the Bank of Spain, but what only one day before the Secretary of State of Social Security said. -Octavio Granat, who is one of the biggest connoisseurs of the labor market and the pension system within the government, acknowledged on Tuesday that there is indeed a risk that the rise of 22% of the SMI destroy jobs. \"This may exist and there is no point in denying it,\" he said. But Calviño, as with organisms, also rejected the pomegranates thesis and maintained that the estimate of economics is that \"the package will have a neutral impact on growth and employment.\"-Calviño's refusals even extended to his own future as he ruled out that his intention was to return to Brussels. Starting next summer, the European Commission must begin its renewal process, and both Community sources and the Government itself point out that Calviño's desire is to hold a relevant position in Europe and that it is also one of the most prepared figures in the Sanchez's executive to do it. But Calviño, unable to contain a smile that made him understand that he could think otherwise, said he is centered in the ministry to \"130%\" and has no time to \"think about something else.\"",

affected by delays or cancellations are entitled to receive accommodation In a hotel as well as transportation to and from the airport. - According to European regulations, if it is necessary to stay in an airport for a cancellation or for a delay of more than three hours, passengers have the right to receive compensation of up to 600 euros. - Ryanair alleges that the interruption of flights resulting from an industrial strike by its flight personnel is an \"extraordinary circumstance\" so that, in its understanding, it will not be obliged to pay compensations. - Ryanair passengers affected in the United Kingdom have filed several compensation claims directly to the airline, which have been rejected, so some of them decided to send their complaints to AviationADR, an agency authorized by the Authority of Civil Aviation, to provide an alternative dispute resolution for passengers ' complaints. - Ryanair has informed the British Aeronautical Authority that it has terminated its agreement with AviationADR. From the CAA, they explain that passengers who submitted a strike-related compensation claim through AviationADR will now have to wait for the outcome of the aviation Authority's resolution. - For

The Court maintains that prosecuted sexual relations were carried out by the defendants 'without the free consent of the victim'.-In what refers to the legal classification of the facts judged, the room - by a majority of 3 to 2 - confirms that such actions constitute sexual abuse continued, because the account of the facts expressly excludes violence.-Likewise, the majority of the Tribunal considered ' doubtful the concurrence of intimidation ' needed to qualify actions as sexual assault, or rape, ' since the facts do not collect essential intimidatory action or threat of the processed, express or implied '.-The ruling now clings to the judgment of the Provincial Court also in the most controversial of his sentence through good appreciation of 'prevalimiento' or 'superiority' rather than intimidation.-Signing three judges recognize, that, 'the subtle line dividing between intimidation and the prevalimiento, hardly perceptible,' because the victim - in the prevalimiento - to some extent also feels intimidated. But the room finally appeals to the favorable to defendants 'in dubio pro reo' principle.-Throughout the judgment, of 104 pages, the room like the reasons raised in the resources. By defenses was invoked the contamination of evidence and the lack of impartiality of the judges, as a result of a parallel and damning Media trial which, as they exposed and affected the evidence caused them defenceless.-The Court, which dismissed for this reason, advertising is not only a principle of management of the process, but also a prerequisite for the exercise of the fundamental right to information that supports through the freedom of the press, without excluding the right of the media to be placed on the information poured. 'Media pressure has not caused helplessness to defendants', you can read failure.  -Not be can presuppose, as do defenses, that journalistic information has been biased or manipulation of public opinion, but an essential part of a social debate, manifesting the desires for Justice of the population; without prejudice to the civil and penal actions which may arise from specific attacks on privacy or fundamental rights of the defendants and the victim. And as the alleged adverse treatment by the media, it is clear that defendants have been able to also intervene in the social debate and making exculpatory statements, says Hall.-Fenders argued also that the complainant provided his consent to full sexual relations with the accused. They insisted that the aggression is inconsistent with the empathy that she showed. They sustained the error in the assessment of the test in its interpretation of the videos.-For the TSJN, the testimony of the victim is 'consistent and persistent' in the criminality. ' Logic is that in the reiteration of the testimony to police authorities and the instruction, and in contrast with other sentencing testimony of witnesses, experts or external evidence, you could find certain differences, omissions, or inaccuracies; but should ponder if they affect to facts or data essential or nuclear, or if they only concern merely peripheral or secondary circumstances ', reason judges.-The room is fully in accordance with this appreciation of the content of the videos. In the view of the room, videos show part aching passivity of the victim and other abusive behaviour of the accused, who begin without some advance and develop without regard to an attack on the right to personal self-determination of the young woman, prevaliendo their number and strength, mocking their situation of helplessness.-And they are ratified in the conviction that in any way it can be understood to be deducted any assent or participation enabled the young 'humiliating acts that are shown in the images', remarks the Court.-The court sees unreasonable in addition conclude a lack of awareness of the five in the abuse and humiliation that inflict the victim. His defense had plantaeado that were not aware of the submission of the complainant State.-The laxity with which the accused apreciasen the consent of the young person is not either excuse of their harmful behavior, half a prevalent disproportion of forces, a radical inferiority in a narrow and oppressive place that hampers your reaction and defesnsa'. And added: 'should have known the painful prostration and humiliation imposed on it'-Major doubts raises the existence of bullying, admits the room, explaining that 'the subtle line between intimidation and the prevalimiento is debated by the case-law', which distinguishes between take advantage of favourable circumstances of time and place, notorious slope that restricts the ability to decide; against the absolute consent, objectively perceptible, and caused absence by force or threat of suffering a badly imminent and serious.-The contested judgment, ponders the Court, didn't find or sustantiviza in the defendants any gesture which shows an intimidating action and that authorize the qualification of aggression wooed in resources, because this decision is limited to tell the facts proven that the victim has adopted an attitude of submission and passivity.-The majority understands that the agravatoria qualification of the facts as sexual assault presupposes to infer a force or threat, even it was implied, that it is not highlighted in the factual story of the contested judgment.-Indeed, they acknowledge, that throughout the extensive and detailed ruling poured expressions, 'vague', of which it might deduced, as they argue the accusations, intimidation and even concluding aggressive and violent defendants, most Apart from the prevalimiento.-And in this sense, continues the Court, the public prosecutor and accusations go shelling purely coercive expressions, such as 'squat, cornered against the wall', 'trap that had tended to the complainant', 'scenario of oppression', ' atmosphere coercive ', 'secluded, narrow, narrow place with a unique output', etc.-However, now that these terms may not removed from its own discursive context, at Headquarters for the evaluation of the test or qualification, whose primary purpose is to justify the prevalimiento is considered. 'Infer violence or threat of scattered expressions throughout the sentence would mean an agravatoria inference', they conclude.-In addition, the TSJN considered one of the five defendants, A. M. G. E., responsible for a crime of robbery with intimidation, which should carry him 2 more years in prison instead of the 900 euros fine fixed by the Court, an offence slight theft by removing the mobile to the complainant.-Finally, the room sends a message back to the Provincial Court, which acquitted the accused of the crime against privacy by mobile phone recordings, and ordered that, with the same composition of the Court, you judgment made exclusively with respect to this crime.-The parties have announced that this ruling will turn to the Supreme Court.

the province of British Columbia, in the west of the country, a gigantic cave of at least 135 meters of depth, of which there was no news until now.-The entrance to the cavern, which has been provisionally baptized as Sarlacc's pit (the Pit of SARLACC), was discovered last April by a helicopter of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change of the Canadian province, which was conducting a census Of caribou in the region. The cave is specifically located in the northeast of the Wells Gray Provincial Park.-The geologist Catherine Hickson, in front of a team that made an expedition to the cave last September, said the discovery \"opens a new chapter\" in the History of Canadian speleology. \"It is absolutely astonishing,\" he said, in statements collected by the agency the Canadian Press. One of the team members, Lee Hollis, was the one who descended the entrance of the cave, reaching down about 80 meters.-The entrance to the cave is about 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. The total depth is calculated at least 135 meters, but it is difficult to determine accurately due to the mist and vapor caused by a waterfall.-Hickson explained, in statements collected by local media, that the cave has the approximate size of a football field: \"Think of a football field, and put it at one end of the cave down,\" he said: \"It's like a gigantic oval hole that descends and Descends. \"-The provisional name of Sarlacc's Pit is due to its alleged similarity to the lair of Sarlacc, a creature from the return of the Jedi movie, from the Star Wars saga. The cave will receive an official name after consulting it with the first (aboriginal) nations of the region.-Although the cave is located in a remote area covered in ice and snow most of the year, the authorities secretly keep their exact location to preserve the unique characteristics of the area.-It is believed that the cave was formed under glacial structures over tens of thousands of years. The reduction of glaciers as a result of climate change and, in particular, the thawing of a nearby glacier, could be the reason why the entrance has now been outdoors, said Hickson.", "title_word":

The sale and purchase of homes by foreigners in Spain have marked a new record. In the first half of the year were 53.359 operations, according to Attorney statistics released Tuesday. It is the highest absolute number of historical series, which starts in the first half of 2007. Then, buyers not Spaniards from homes were many less (about 33,000), and the figure collapsed in 2008 with the crisis. The recovery began to notice beginning in 2014 and since almost every semester registered a growth of two digits. In fact, that data, year on year growth, is the only smear in the brand new: with regard to the first half of 2017 represents a growth of 5.4 percent, the lowest since 2013.-Also in the average price per square metre of real estate acquired by foreigners is a small turning point, that remains to be seen if it is confirmed in the upcoming statistics. It stood at 1.687 euros, a figure that does not improve the previous semester (when the average price was 1,716 euros) for the first time in five years. In any case, the amount grows if a 0.9% YOY, by which prices are rising with respect to the same period of the previous year from 2014.-And another thing that remains unchanged is that the British are foreigners who buy more houses in Spain. 7.613 sale operations had as protagonists to United Kingdom citizens, 8.8% more than in the first half of last year. There is also no surprise in second and third place on the podium, which corresponded to French (4.211 operations, down 4.6%) and German (4.138 operations, 2.1% less). Followed by Romanians (3.872 purchases) and Moroccan, representing the first non-EU nationality with 3.662 operations. In addition, advance the Italians after a growth of 28.8% to be among the top five of the classification. Two other nationalities that grew most were Irish (24.7%) and Danes (18.2%), while purchases by Swiss citizens shrank 13.2%.-In terms of the places where foreigners buy real estate, Valencia continues leading the number of operations by a wide margin. It was the destination of 15.613 operations, nearly one out of every three sales were recorded there, and was also the community which grew more (a 16.7% year on year) among which attract more foreigners looking for a home in Spain. Second, Andalusia, he repeated with 9.737 purchases and an interannual increase of 8.2 per cent, and the third was Catalonia, where operations (7.570) fell 5.3% over the same period of the previous year. Also declined purchases in the Canary Islands, the fourth ranked, with 5.312 operations (10.6% less), while Madrid was the fifth favorite destination of foreigners who buy home with 4.911 operations, representing one 5.4% more than in the first half of a year ago.-Notary statistic also differs between foreigners who have residence permit and who do not have it. The first still dominate purchases with 56% of the operations. This differentiation is applied when it comes to point out what are the two most numerous nationalities in each autonomous community, which sometimes can be repeated.-In Valencia, for example, the British are the dominant nationality of the total amount of purchases and sales in both categories. Between operations carried out foreign card of residence in Spain, the United Kingdom citizens accounted for 12%, the same percentage as the Romanians. Among those who invested in a home in Valencian territory without residence in Spain, Britons accounted for 21 percent, followed by Sweden with 14%.-In Andalusia happens something similar, with British and Moroccan tied in front of shopping for residents (16% both nationalities), whereas non-residents are among the British (28%) of the Swedes (13%),-In Catalonia the Moroccan (13%) the nationality as more houses are buying ahead of the French (10%). However, the French non-residents are leaders in that category (44%) a lot from the Germans (7%). And in Madrid the Romanians (19%) are foreign residents who buy more homes, while the majority of non-residents are Chinese (18%) and Italian (7%)-Germans, Italians and British copan purchases in island communities. In the Canary Islands nationality more frequently among residents is the Italian (31%) followed by the German (12%), while those positions are exchanged between non-residents and dominate the Germans (20%) by a narrow margin over Italians (20%). In the Balearic Islands the Germans dominate widely both categories, while Italians (15%) are the second most numerous between the residents and the British (15%) among non-residents.-In the rest of autonomies, the British were largest community among non-residents in other two Coast territories, while they dominated only one interior operations. It is Murcia, Asturias and La Rioja. In that same segment of foreigners who do not usually live in Spain, the French dominate all other communities, Aragon, Navarra, country Vasco, Cantabria, Castile and Leon, Castile - La Mancha and Extremadura.-The only exception is Galicia, where the most numerous nationality between non-residents and residents is the Portuguese. When residents, subject to the exceptions mentioned before, Moroccan and Romanian are distributed as most numerous nationality between all communities. The citizens of Romania were the most active in the sale and purchase of Aragon, Basque country, Cantabria, Asturias, La Rioja, Castile and León and Castile - La Mancha.

like Zuckerberg about their fight against disinformation campaigns. As of January 1, and at least until the elections to the European Parliament are held in May 2019, the large Internet platforms must report to Brussels on a monthly basis on the outcome of their combat against fake news and, in particular , on closed false accounts, crawling bots (messages propagated automatically without human interaction) or how they collaborate with external data and content verifiers.-Among the companies required to report are Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter, which last October signed with the EU a voluntary code of conduct in which they pledged to redouble efforts against fake news. The Code provides for an annual review. But Brussels has decided to narrow the siege after witnessing the imminent risk that digital hoaxes will multiply in the coming months.-The detailed monthly verification is part of the action Plan against disinformation approved on Wednesday by the European Commission, whose primary objective is to shield the more than 50 elections planned in the EU countries over the next 24 months, Including the European elections. In Spain, in addition to the elections to the European Parliament, regional elections will be held on 26 May in 13 communities and municipalities throughout the country.-The Commission's plan considers that the disinformation campaigns against the Community institutions and against the EU in general will \"increase in all likelihood in the final stretch towards the elections of May 2019\". And it goes without telling that the target of the attackers is no other than to discredit the institutions and their representatives and \"undermine the European project itself\".-The document describes the fake news as one of the weapons of the hybrid war in which several foreign powers have embarked. And openly accuses Russia of being one of the main aggressors.-\"There is a lot of evidence pointing to Russia as one of the main sources of disinformation in Europe,\" said the vice-president of the Digital Area Commission, Andrus Ansip, during the presentation of the Plan in Brussels. \"Misinformation is part of Russia's military doctrine and its strategy is to weaken and divide the West,\" added Ansip.-The EU realized the Russian threat from 2014, during the Moscow-Ukraine conflict. The commission created a \"strategic communication\" unit dedicated to detecting and countering disinformation campaigns. Despite its scarce means (just over a dozen people), the unit has identified more than 4,500 examples of digital Infundios propagated from Russia since 2015.-The digital flood of falsehoods, according to Brussels, has arreciado above all, around electoral appointments within the EU or during times of tension with Moscow, like the Syrian war, the demolition of a commercial plane in Ukrainian airspace (with dozens of dead , many of them Europeans) or following the recent chemical attack in the United Kingdom (attributed to the Kremlin).-The new Plan envisages hiring 11 more people before the May elections and half a hundred people in two years, among data analysts, multi-lingual researchers and communication experts. The draft European budgets for 2019 also envisages doubling the budget of the Strategic Information Unit, which will go from 1.8 billion in 2018 to 5 billion next year.", "title_word": ["many",

adopted by Decree-Law in the opposite direction, more when those go on the socialist line to use and are recent, but that is precisely what has just happened in Havana. In an unexpected twist, the government of the new Cuban president, Miguel Díaz-Canel, amended a set of rules that restricted private initiative and increased controls on the exercise of self-employment, regulations that had been very Criticized by the population in recent months.-The rules for \"perfecting\" non-state work entered into force on 7 December, and among the most unpopular were those that restricted the capacity of private restaurants to 50 chairs per establishment, forbade the employed to have two Licenses to carry out different activities and forced the workers to open an account at the bank in which they had to reflect all their activities.-Many of the employed and owners of palates had expressed discontent at the seminars organized by the authorities to explain the new regulations, and the most buoyant businesses had begun firing their employees because of the brake Bureaucratic force that forced them to reduce their capacity. But on Wednesday night, the announcement of the repeal was lived with real euphoria in these establishments. In a well-known Italian palate, the owner pressed his fists and leaped with joy to hear the minister of Labour and Social Security, Margarita González: \"My Mama! Those who had to leave tomorrow are saved. \"-González herself, who was in charge of defending the restrictions until days before, was the one who announced the reverse on television with the argument that the critical opinions of the employed had been taken into account and that it was also done not to discriminate against The private workers of the state, where it is permissible the moonlighting. The countermeasures were immediately published in the Official Gazette, something that also draws attention, because normally in Cuba legal times are more paused.-Although it was not published in the official press and only knew the most informed, the change was precipitated on Monday in the Faculty of Law, during a visit made by President Miguel Díaz-Canel. During an exchange with students and professors, the heir of Raúl Castro criticized without ambages the limit of the 50 chairs and the prohibition that a person could not have more than one license, said that that did not have feet nor head and announced to the auditorium that it was going to Beg. At that moment, one of the jurists says there, the auditorium stood up and ovationed him. With this surprising change of course, rectification, updating or whatever you want to call it, Diaz-Canel adopts, without doubt, the most popular measure of his mandate, which began in April when the presidency happened to Raúl Castro, who promoted in 2010 an opening of the sector Private. In Cuba, 157,000 workers were self-employed; Today there are 589,000, 13% of those occupied in the country.-Although the scope is limited, because not only of palates lives the man or of them depends the development of the country, the fact has national impact and many have read it in political key: \"Díaz-Canel has heard the criticisms and rectify something that was a nonsense , and in that sense expresses a will and legitimizes itself, \"commented the owner of a private business usually critical of the government's decisions. It pointed out, moreover, another interesting thing: the normal so far, when there was an unpopular decree which one decided not to apply for counterproductive, is that it will not be executed and point. But to recognize in public and with laws the error, is a novelty. \"And that, in the conditions of Cuba, is a brave thing,\" he pointed.-Until now the restriction of the 50 chairs existed, but the owners of palates were worth several loopholes to expand the capacity, for example having two or three licenses in the same premises. The new Decree-Law establishes that the boundary will now be \"in correspondence with the capacity of the locals.\" Many would like in Cuba to continue with that line.", "title_word": ["private",

student leader abducted and shot dead in 1980, when she was 19, by militants of the ultra-right-wing party new force. A week later, the plaque appeared tainted by a swastika, as if someone wanted to add to the murder of the young woman the death of her memory. Last weekend, a neighbor found the commemorative plaque in the trash and decided to make it safe saving in his apartment. Someone had ripped off the plate, leaving only the mast that held it. The neighbors replaced it with a laminated poster.-This is what is read in the commemorative sign: \"Yolanda González Martín. She was a student leader, worker and militant of the Socialist Workers ' Party. He fought for real democracy, justice and social and labour rights. In February 1980, she was abducted at her home in Aluche and killed by a fascist commando. I was 19 years old. These gardens are dedicated to his remembrance, which is still alive. \"-\"It gives rage. It produces pain. It is the best reflection of what is and remains the right and violent totalitarianism, which takes the front of everyone who does not think like them, \"laments Mar Noguerol, who shared the floor with Gonzalez and her boyfriend until that Friday February 1, 1980 , when the Ultrarightist Emilio Hellín kidnapped and killed in a wilderness with the collaboration of other Ultras. \"It was a woman who had things very clear, very independent, firm, idealistic, as we were all the people of that generation that we cast massively to the streets and militancy to end the dictatorship and that the transition was not something half\" Reasons. \"Sixteen years old, he became interested in politics. He came to Madrid for love, to start a life with his partner, \"go on. \"They came to live at my house, to the splicing floor, where they took it,\" he adds. And he laments, \"It has cost Me years to return.\"-There it is a floor of 60 square meters in the number 101 of the street Tembleque, in the Madrid district of Aluche. The place to which it moves González, a Basque girl daughter of Burgos emigrated, to live with Alejandro Arizcun, her boyfriend. Installed in it participates in demonstrations by the democracy and lives with passion its militancy, dividing its time between the work of cleaner and the studies of electronics. It's the place where it all ended that February 1, 1980.-Someone's knocking on the door. On the floor are not Noguerol or your partner. Gonzalez opens the door. On the other side are the members of the group 41, a criminal gang related to the ultra-right-wing force new. The following is recorded in the Hemerotechs and in the judicial archives. They reduce it. They search the floor for evidence linking it to ETA, although Gonzalez has nothing to do with the terrorist band. They put her in a car. Struggle. They interrogate her during the journey. They arrive in a wilderness near the road that connects Alcorcón and San Martín de Valdeiglesias. And there, in the middle of nowhere, I descerrajan three shots. \"New force militants murdered Yolanda Gonzalez\", titled On the cover Country shortly thereafter.-It has been almost 40 years of that terrible crime that shocks the country and seems drawn from a thriller, because it includes until the escape of the murderer to Paraguay. However, the plaque that reminds the murder victim has not lasted a month.-\"It's inexplicable,\" says Carlos Fonseca, author of Don't Forget Me. Yolanda González, the most brutal crime of the transition (planet), a work that reconstructs the life of the young woman through the testimonies of her relatives, photographs and documents. \"Yolanda was not the leader of any party, nor was he a particularly significant person,\" continues this long-standing journalist. \"She was killed with viciously,\" she laments. and stresses: \"I do not fit in the head what I hate or what can there be to a girl murdered in such a brutal way 38 years ago and whose crime, in quotation marks, was to be a young woman of the left and of her time.\"-\"A neighbor of the neighborhood found the plaque in a dumpster, was angry, recovered and warned us,\" rebuilds Carlos Sanchez Mato (IU), who chairs the municipal board. \"That plaque is no longer worth anything, since it is damaged, but at the same time it is worth a lot, because it shows that in Madrid there are people who are worth it,\" he adds, referring to the neighbors. \"When we did the inauguration, there were threats. They are cowards that all they do is miserable performances like plucking a plaque in memory of a student killed by fascists, \"he adds. \"That's abject,\" he stresses. \"And of course, we're going to replenish it.

the prisoners in Spain. According to the flood of statistical data that the Ministry of the Interior has sent to the Senate, among the three nationalities are currently 6,190 inmates of the 13,400 foreigners who are admitted to the centers dependent on the Central administration, or Is 46.1% of the total non-indigenous incarcerated.-If the prisoners are added to the Catalan prisons (the Generalitat has transferred this competition), the foreign prison colony rises to 17,146 people. Or what is the same, in the prisons of the whole country (Ministry of the Interior more Catalonia) had in February this year 60,053 internal, of which 28.5% was of foreign origin.-The reports sent by penitentiary institutions to which this newspaper has access, allow for the first time to make a deep radiograph of the foreign criminality. It is not usual for the government to make public the nationalities of prisoners to avoid stigmatization.-The disaggregated data-only referring to the Central administration-indicate that only these three nationalities exceed the thousand inmates: The Moroccans are, at a distance, the largest collective with 3,125 internal, followed by Romanians (1,594) and Colombians ( 1,471). Only two other countries exceed half a thousand prisoners: Ecuador (585) and the Dominican Republic (529).-The vast majority of foreign prisoners already have a conviction. In the indoor centers there are 3,147 foreigners in remand (pending trial), 10,098 with sentence and 155 in a situation of preventive but while serving a sentence for another summary.-Home statistics do not specify what is the crime that brought foreigners to prison, but the data on the ' Province of residence ' in Spain prior to the arrest would point to a large part of them being caught at the border, probably by a Drug trafficking offense. Exactly one-third of foreign inmates in domestic prisons, 4,527, does not have a pre-residence province, so it is inferred that they came directly from the outside when they were arrested.-Apart from nationalities and provenance within Spain, the other important fact of the last statistics of the Interior is the important decline in number and proportion of the foreign inmate population. A decade ago, in 2007, non-Spanish inmates were 20,732 in front of a general population (including Catalonia) of 64,710. That is, almost a third, exactly 32%, of the inmates was foreign. That proportion has now been reduced to 28.5% (17,146 non-national prisoners compared to a total population of 60,053). The reduction of the general prison population between 2007 and 2017 was 7.8% compared to 17.3% of the foreign collective.-The figures are even more striking if the current statistics are compared with those of 2010, when the Spanish prisons marked one of their historical maxima. Then, there were 27,264 foreign prisoners in the state and Catalan centres, practically 10,000 inmates more than now. In that 2010, the foreign Penitentiary colony was 35.5% of the 76,634 prisoners who came to house the penitentiaries of the country.", "title_word": ["moroccan", "Romanian", "Colombian", "already",

courts next month or even at the end of January. I mean, in just over 20 days. The Minister of Education, Isabel Celaá, denied, however, that there was another urgency to solve very hard problems that pivoted on the system-The text, which will allow the Generalitat to banish definitively Castilian from the classrooms, must still pass through the Council of State before reaching the Council of Ministers to become a bill and, thus, be sent to the courts for approval. However, the government will go ahead, say what the educational community says, as well as the supreme Government consultative body. There is no reason to wait for the report of the Council of State, defended Celaá. It is not obligatory, accompanied by Fernando Gurrea, undersecretary of education and FP.-The draft Organic law that seeks to amend the LOE, approved by the Socialists in 2006, and repeal the LOMCE (better known as ' Ley Wert ') is going forward amid strong criticism, not only the opposition, but also broad sectors Education, such as that of concerted and trade unions, who do not understand the urgency of approving the new text, especially when they see an absolute lack of consensus. -During the presentation of the text to the Autonomous Communities, in the framework of the Sectoral education conference that took place yesterday, the PP criticized the ' lack of dialogue '. In addition, the new draft of the government's ' Cosmic Fudge ' was branded and it was warned that the reform will allow the communities to do what they want and ' with impunity to tell the story they want, with the results we have already seen in Catalonia '. ' Today they win the Independendistas ', criticized Fernando Rey, Minister of Education of Castilla y León.  -The draft was passed on Tuesday by the plenary of the State school board and was approved by a small margin of votes. A total of 120 amendments were approved to the new law that the government assured it will evaluate to incorporate. What got Celaá in the plenary of the state's highest consultative body on education is to keep the free way that the new law gives communities like Catalonia to decide how many subjects are taught in Castilian and how many in Catalan.  -How did you manage it? The report of the Permanent Committee of the School board criticized that the new text allocated a marginal use to the Spanish language so they did not consider it advisable for the ' Central administration to make a total delegation of its vehicular use in the educational field to the Autonomous administrations '. However, this consideration was finally eliminated.  -To stop situations like this, the education counselor of Madrid, Rafael van Grieken, on behalf of all the communities of the PP (Castilla y León, Galicia, Murcia and La Rioja), requested the ' Return of the draft ' and put on the table of the Sectoral conference L (a) the possibility of ' enhancing and reinforcing the powers of the state ' within the framework of the Constitution. Among them, the establishment of a common curriculum for all Spain, a high state inspection that fulfils its function and, ultimately, that communities enjoy an educational equality for all Spain, said Van Grieken. The Madrid councillor also ensured that communities should enforce state regulations ' with as much loyalty as possible; Loyalty that not in all communities has been present ', in allusion to Catalonia, ' where there has been a deviation from the national parameters '. The reinforcement of competencies was described by Celaá as ' retrograde '. ' Our proposal is constitutional and is to protect Spain from Autonomy ', defended the minister.  -The PP wanted to unmark the requirement of Vox to guarantee the inauguration in Andalusia (hours before the agreement was closed) and insisted on the need to ' reinforce ' the powers of the state, but not to return them, as pretended the party of Santiago Abasca L. ' It's a disorderly return the powers, ' said King. And the PP's were not the only ones. The PSOE's advisors also opposed this option. The Andalusian councillor, Sonia Gaya, noted that the proposal does not solve anything, and that it is not possible to ' decide to 600 kilometers the needs of a specific region '. ' Self-government is fundamental and we do not see anything that justifies giving it up ', he criticized, for his part, Counsellor María Solana, of Geroa Bai, one of the parties that form the Navarre government.  -Both counselors supported the text of the government as did Vicent Marzà, the Valencian Community Education counselor who said he was happy to leave the step behind the LOMCE. However, it called for further progress, including the promotion of coeducation. -On the other hand, the PP communities demanded a state pact in the field of education, and they called for a law that bets on quality and fairness and that respects freedom, starting with the choice of families, who must be free when choosing the center Ed Ucativo for his children, defended Carmen Pomar, Councillor of Education of Galicia. The councillor of the Government of Aragon, Mayte Pérez, recognized his concern for the obligation to quote for the practices of the university students and of professional training. Although it is not an education competition, we ask that you move our concern to the new standard. Education, for its part, recognized that it knew of this new regulation included in a Royal decree Law on revaluation of the public pensions.

afternoon of timid truce, the three actors who have made it possible to change color in the Junta de Andalucía re-shoot cross reviews. The reproaches fly, especially between Cs and Vox, the two supports in which the PP has supported the absolute majority that will lead to Juanma Moreno to San Telmo. While the ultra-right party claims the validity of the 37 measures agreed with the popular, the orange formation stresses with zeal that it does not feel questioned by what it considers wet paper. And in the midst of the crossfire, the PP presumes to champion the centrality.  -Next Wednesday 16th January PP, Cs and Vox will add their 59 seats to end the 36 years of PSOE on the board and Invest Juanma Moreno. So far, and not beyond, are joined the roads of Cs and Vox, as have insisted on Thursday several members of the Orange party, always reluctant to sit at the same table as those of Santiago Abascal since the count of the last December 2 awarded the Ultraderechist As the key for an alternative majority to Susana Diaz. -There is no agreement with the extreme right or extreme left, defended Albert Rivera, glancing at the warnings that come from beyond the Pyrenees to be pacted with Vox. Thus, for the president of Cs, the Entente initialled this Wednesday by PP and Vox has no value. It's wet paper, it's emphasized.  -Another thing, Rivera said, is that during the legislature, Vox, we can or the PSOE bring to debate laws or legislative amendments that can be negotiated, emphasizing that it is one thing to live together in Parliament and reach agreements, as Cs has done also with we can , and another is to govern, remembering that the executive has two faces: the PP and his party.  -The Government's policies will be those signed by PP and Cs, followed by the head of Dilas of Oranges in Andalusia – and next vice-President of the board, Juan Marín. I do not link the agreements that PP and Vox have signed, what Mr. Ortega Smith has negotiated with Moreno will have to discuss it among them, because we are not negotiating with Vox -In this sense, and in the same way that Rivera admitted, Marín explained that when the new Andalusian government gets underway, they will have to talk to all the political forces during the legislature to get ahead of the budgets or bills. That is what the new policy is based on, we will sit down and talk to everyone; Another question is who will support one measure or another, has added Marín, who has criticized that some want to repeal laws with 12 seats, and that cannot be, in reference to Vox.  -This is a three-legged stool, has graphically replicated the spokesman for Vox in Andalusia, Francisco Serrano. They will have time to meet us, we are not what they say we are, said Serrano after remembering that his dozen deputies are key.  -That is why the ultra-right-wing training will require respect for the totally reasonable measures agreed with the PP. Measures which, in their opinion, defend Spain, the equality of the Spaniards, the family, the life, and they go against the corruption clientelar and C Gainst ideological totalitarianism on the left. -Even more blunt has been shown by the president of Vox, Santiago Abascal. There will only be change in Andalusia for the votes and for the patriotism of Vox. And there will be despite the selfishness, irresponsibility and obedience of others, the Basque politician has argued. Abascal has been very critical of what he understands as the gestures of Rivera to the messages coming from the Elysium: I understand that the French party has to strive not to disturb its President Macron. But things are as they are, he commented, with irony. -The Secretary general of the far right training, Javier Ortega Smith, has completed the speech warning that they will be vigilant before their agreement signed with the PP. If you do not understand (citizens), it is better to let those who are willing to do it. And it is that according to Ortega Smith, the orange formation is trying to veto points of the agreement PP-Cs: We have received the news that it is already maneuvering for one of the signed agreements to be converted into wet paper. Maneuvers which, according to the secretary general of Vox, are neither loyal nor democratic. Perhaps he is accustomed to receiving instructions through the Elysium and that what he signs is not taken into practice, but for Vox what is signed is going to be put into practice, has emphasized.  -and at the center of both flanks you want to place the PP, who has boasted of the centrality that has demonstrated his party after the historic agreement with Vox and Cs, which, as he said, puts an end to almost four decades of government clientele and corrupt PSOE in Andalusia. Yesterday the Popular party showed that it is the only party in the center and can agree on the right and left, said his president, Pablo Casado, to slip the option of repeating this double pact in other territories. -The useful vote is PP, has vindicated at a time of high fragmentation of the vote in the right to put the Andalusian example as a measure of the capacity of Genoa to interpret the figure of arbitrator in the negotiations between other parties. It starts 2019, decisive year at the polls, and all the actors want to define their trench.

These are bursts of bursts of radio waves (FRB), very short, barely last milliseconds, which come from far from our galaxy, the Milky Way. Its origin is unknown, although the astronomers consider that they are generated by powerful astrophysical phenomena to billions of light years, like black holes or superdense neutron stars merging.-The discovery, which has been published in two articles in the journal Nature and presented on the same day at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society, is one of the first results obtained by the Chime Telescope, inaugurated at the end of 2017 and located in The Okanagan Valley, in British Columbia (Canada). -This is the second burst of FRB that has been recorded so far. To this end, the scientists analyzed a three-week period during the summer of 2018, when Chime was not yet running at full capacity. And they detected 13 explosions, one of them the FRB of repetition. Additionally, in the following weeks additional bursts of FRB were detected that were repeated.-The Arecibo radio telescope, in Puerto Rico, had observed these bursts of explosions in 2015, after the FRB were first detected-fortuitously-in 2007, when they identified an outbreak in Radioastronomy data obtained in 2001. That FRB identified by Arecibo came from a single source. and to date they were the only ones with this feature.-\"So far, only one known a repeated FRB. Knowing that there is another suggests that there might be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for the study, we can understand these cosmic enigmas – where they come from and what causes them, ' points out in a press release Ingrid Stairs, member of the Chime and Astrophysics team at the University of British Columbia.-Most of the 13 bursts were recorded at exceptionally low frequencies, of 400 MHz, which is the lowest frequency that chime can detect, while the previously detected FRB had been found at frequencies close to 1400 MHz. And showed signs of scattering, a phenomenon that informs about the environment surrounding a source of radio waves. Thus, the amount of dispersion observed by the scientists concluded that the FRB should come from powerful astrophysical objects.-Given this discovery, some scientists, such as Avi Loeb, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysics Center, according to the Guardian, have postulated more extravagant theories, such as these mysterious extragalactic signals could be signals from A more technologically advanced alien civilization. -Repeating bursts of radio waves detected for first time since initial accidental discovery in 2007", "title_word": ["mysterious", "detect", "deep",

of Education to recognise a Commissioner and (l) Bachelor's degree.  -According to these sources, the Staff Division's legal team considers that the ruling of the supreme only affects the appellant, who has 60 credits of the degree of URJC. They remember that the controls that are currently part of the police dome have accredited 240 credits, which for the purposes of the Regulation enables them to maintain the qualification for which they receive a salary that corresponds to the highest positions of the Administration.  -The sentence does not nullify the university degree, refers to a particular case, emphasize the aforementioned sources of the Directorate General of the police. -After the controversy over the master in the URJC of the former president of the community of Madrid Cristina Cifuentes, the union ASP filed a complaint with the prosecutor to investigate the alleged plot that allowed the titling of different controls through a GR ADO at this university. This Thursday, the organization has interpreted that the judgement of the supreme what it did is to give him the reason because it nullified the courses for the higher scale that granted the degree in criminology.  -In statements to Europa Press, the SUP-majority spokesman in the police--, Ramón Cosío, has regretted that the body remains without an academic model that recognizes vocational training in a standardized way. -We are giving an image of precariousness really unfair, always in the midst of foreign interests that only bring more instability to an already unsound situation, putting in question the qualifications of the candidates and their appointments, has Added. The opinion of the SUP, however, is that the decision of the supreme does not affect the police officers in its entirety.  -The Rey Juan Carlos University of Madrid announced on Thursday that it will appeal the Supreme Court for helplessness, having not been a party to the cause despite the fact that the case refers to a degree given from the course 2010-2011 to date. He has also defended the legality and validity of this qualification.  -The appellant is currently chief curator and interested on July 16, 2014, under the repealed order of 18 April 2000, to be recognized that his training first as an inspector and then as a Commissioner was equivalent to the title of graduate Univ Ersitario.  -For access to the executive scale, either by opposition or promotion, article 17 of the Organic Law 2/1986, of 13 March, deforces and security forces required as a minimum qualification to be a diploma, Technical architect, technical engineer or equ titration. Ivalente. Today it is necessary to graduate official university degree.  -Now, it recognizes equivalence with a university degree to those who access to the executive scale, that is, Inspector, by opposition and after overcoming training at the National Police School with a load workload estimated at 178 credits, Comparable to a second university cycle.  -According to the ruling, the appellant applied the same rule to those with that qualification have studied or were pursuing promotion studies to access the executive and higher scales and also for those who were integrated under the Transitori regime Or LOFCS on these scales without having that average degree.  -But the order regulating that possibility was repealed in 2011. However, in its single transitory provision it was envisaged that it would continue to apply until 30 September 2015, to whom, on the date of entry into force of this order, they had obtained the appointment of Inspector of the National police force, but they had not Completed the teachings leading to diplomas, technical engineer, technical architect, Licentiate, engineer or architect.  -according to that standard, the appellant requested that this equivalence regime be applied. By not being a graduate, technical architect or technical engineer, he presented as equivalent title the degree in criminology obtained in the King Juan Carlos.  -The government dismissed such an application because one of the paragraphs of the order requires being in possession of a diploma, Technical architect, technical engineer or equivalent title, requirements that it did not comply with.

on Friday the Council of Ministers a strengthened system of control of exports of defence material, which includes sending inspectors to the target countries of armaments, as they have confirmed government sources to The paper. The standard shall not be retroactive, i.e. it will only affect exports which are closed from the entry into force, about four or five months.-The executive defends that it is an \"innovative and transversal\" system, since only the United States, Germany and Switzerland have models of presence control in the country of destination, called ' ex-post monitoring '. The initiative, arose in the mandate of the PP, but accelerated with the arrival of Pedro Sánchez to the Moncloa.  This is not a proposal that arises in the heat of the controversy over the dispatch of the 400 bombs to Saudi Arabia last September, although the President of the Government already pointed out in his appearance before Congress on this issue that the controls would be strengthened. Secretary of State for Trade, Xiana Méndez, also informed the Defense Commission and the oenegés that they are calling for more supervision and to cancel sales to dangerous countries.-This is a modification of royal decree 679/2014 of 1 August, which regulates exports of defence material. In principle, at the expense of the text that this Friday approves the government, the intention of the Moncloa is to be able to send inspectors to \"destinies Sensibles & Rdquor. It is about to reveal which countries are included in that category and which exported weapons will receive that more thorough follow-up.-So far, the executive has argued that the implementation of this audit should be progressive and is linked to acceptance by importing countries. The Secretary of State for Trade, which has promoted the initiative, has so far maintained the necessary \"acquiescence & rdquor of the buyers to send the inspectors with the assurance that they will be able to carry out their work with all the guarantees and that They will receive the required documentation from the authorities of those countries of destination. This conformity, admits the Ministry, will depend to a large extent on the diplomatic relations that maintain Spain with them.-The Government's intention, moreover, is to make the EU complicit in this strengthened control system, so that the rest of the countries adopt it. Until now, only the United States, Germany, and Switzerland send inspectors to the target countries of their weapons.-For the oenegés is good news, but not enough. \"In the absence of seeing the text, the measure is very positive, we have been asking for twenty years, crying in the desert, but it is not enough & Rdquor,\" says Alberto Estévez, coordinator of the Campaign Arms under Control of Amnesty International, FundiPau, Greenpeace and Oxfam Intermón.  In his view, the degree of effectiveness of the new system would depend on three issues: that it should be applied in a generalized manner or only by specific projects; That includes all armaments or only one part; And to be endowed with sufficient resources.-Amnesty International also calls for increased parliamentary scrutiny and the Congress of Deputies to be empowered to paralyze certain exports to countries considered at risk, as is the case in the United States.-In addition, it claims that the reports of the agency authorizing and denying exports, the Inter-Ministerial Board for Trade and control of defence material and dual-use technologies (JIMDDU) are published. Now they cannot be revealed, since they are protected by law 9/1968 on official secrets. -The technicians of the JIMDDU are those who analyse the export requests, an analysis in which they must take into account the Spanish norms and the international agreements to prevent that the weapons are derived to third countries, for unforeseen purposes or to certain Armed conflicts. -Arms under Control argues that Spain should not export arms to countries like Saudi Arabia, for its use in the war in Yemen and because they understand that there are \"clear evidence\" that Riyadh bought weapons from the Soviet environment for groups in Syria and Yemen. The NGO calls for \"bravery\" to Sanchez to go beyond what was raised in the legislature of Mariano Rajoy.-In 2017 Spain exported defence material worth 4.346 billion euros, 7% more than the previous

publishes the word \"accepted\" after the statement of a motion of condemnation to Francoism. And that would give the appearance of normalcy in the debate on the exhumation of Franco if it were not because after that \"accepted\" there is in fact a majority of abstentions, 136, and only one third of affirmative votes.-The upper house has not made, as proposed by the motion presented by the PSOE, \"a rotunda condemnation\" of a military dictatorship with tens of thousands of victims. Once again, Partido Popular, citizens, Forum Asturias and Union of the people of Navarre have abstained from expressing that condemnation. They saved the motion 97 votes of the Socialist Group, United we can and the Catalan nationalists, Canaries and Basques.-And it is not that I did not want to discuss it: when the socialist spokesman Francesc Antich ascended to the lectern to defend it, the motion \"on exhumation of Francisco Franco Bahamonde of the Valley of the fallen and the modification and improvement of the law of historical Memory\" had Presented 44 amendments, including 29 of the Joint Group, 21 Senators Carles Mulet and Jordi Navarrete (Compromís), one of the popular group and one of the senator of EH-Bildu Jon Iñarritu.-Test for PP-Socialist Senator Tontxu Rodriguez has said that the popular \"stings\" this motion because-paraphrasing the hymn of Phalanx ' Face to the sun '-\"sink their biological and ideological roots\" in \"The new shirt, the victorious flags and the Spain in which it begins to Sunrise. \"-And the DART has lifted the protests of the blue seats. The Canarian senator of the popular group Joel Delgado has argued that the PP condemns the francoism \"as it could not be otherwise\", and then clarify that the Spaniards do not care where they rest the remains of Franco.-Also popular Carlos Aragonese has found that the presentation of the motion has a date with \"electoral significance\", looking to Andalusia, and also the plan to \"put your finger in the eye to the PP\" in the week of 20N, anniversary of the death of Franco.-The PP has a political commitment that is even more important to solve. Paul married meditates against the clock whether or not they present to the constitutional a recourse against the decree law of exhumation. The popular spokesperson for the Congress, Dolors Montserrat, assured the Francisco Franco Foundation that they would present it. The deadline for appeal is finished on Monday 26, in the middle of the Andalusian electoral campaign, and in the direction of the PP have not decided whether or not they carry the recourse to the judge, reports Pilar Santos.   -Jokin Bildarratz, of the PNV, he showed his skepticism with an argument similar to that of the Aragonese senator, wondering if the motion serves the PSOE to \"keep sticking his finger in the eye\" to the PP. The PNV has voted ' yes ', but criticizing that, in fact, nothing has been contributed that does not  is already in the law of historical memory.-It has been much less critical, from the ranks of the joint group, the senator of the Herreña Group (Canarian Coalition) Pablo Rodríguez Cejas, who has even read on the stand some testimony of the repression, remembering how on his island the Falangists gave \"de Lashes \"to the peasant who did not give them their potatoes.-The Valencian of Compromís Carles Mulet has also voted ' yes ', but insisting, as usual, on his idea that the valley of the fallen should be blown up. The Catalan nationalists have not gone so far. At the PDeCAT, in the words of Joan Bagué, it seems to him that, as the socialist motion was raised \"it is impossible\" to disagree. To ERC, according to Senator Miquel Àngel, it seems that the motion lacked \"courage\" to remove the \"nostalgic right\" its \"appropriation\" of the historical narrative. Even many schoolchildren, lamented the Republican, do not know the true dimension of Franco's \"criminal regime.\"-United we can have descended more to the concrete getting to place one of its amendments, on the nullity of the sentences pronounced in the francoism and demanding, in the voice of Joan Comorera, that it is prevented that Franco ends up buried in the cathedral of the Almudena.-As in other votes, citizens have avoided condemnation with the feint that the motion does not seek consensus. The exhumation of the remains of Franco arises, says the spokesman Orange, Tomás Marcos, \"in a hasty way.\" Socialist Ander Gil, the father of the motion, regretted that \"rights parties\" had been abstaining, believing that \"in any country in Europe\" it would have won unanimity.", "title_word": ["PP", "citizens", "avoid", "condemn", "francoism", "Senate"], "subtitle_word": ["party", "right",

In 2017, a total of 2,336 people lost their lives because a piece of food or other object prevented them from breathing and no one was able to help them expel it, according to the National Institute of Statistics (INE). Only the number of suicides (3,679) and accidental Fall deaths (3,057) are placed above.-Most of those who died choking were over 65 years old (2,112). Something that the secretary general of the Spanish Society of Otolaryngology, Raimundo Gutiérrez, blamed to dysphagia, ie to the difficulty swallowing that appears as a symptom of many diseases. \"People who have suffered a stroke, have ALS or neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's are very likely to develop swallowing problems and therefore must follow a diet adapted to their limitations,\" he says on the phone. However, INE data indicate that of total asphyxiation deaths, only 212 were due to food choking. The rest were caused by other objects. \"Pills and denture fragments are the most common,\" says Gutierrez, who is also the head of the Otolaryngology unit at the Rey Juan Carlos Hospital. And he adds: \"In the case of children, toys and marbles are the most common elements.\"-The physician warns that there are cases of choking that, while not producing the immediate death of the sufferer, become aspirational pneumonias when moving the object to the lung and generate an infection that can end with the death of the patient . \"And these deaths do not appear in the statistics,\" he ditches. Last year, four children under 14 years old choked by objects and three for food. The last, Tiago, a 3-year-old boy who choked last year's end because of a grape in Gijón (Asturias). The youngest arrived at the Hospital of Jove without breathing and the attempts of resuscitation were failed.-\"Age is fundamental in these cases, since minors have not yet developed the ability to swallow, and the elderly are losing it,\" says Antonio Guzmán, director of promotion Mapfre Salud. The foundation of this insurer launched in 2015 the SOS campaign breathes and developed a mobile application, available on IOS and Android, which explains through videos how to act to reverse a choking.-To develop this software have had the collaboration of the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine and Emergencies (Shemesh). In addition, they have conducted courses aimed at innkeepers to know the maneuver of Heimlich, which consists of abdominal compression to release the respiratory duct. \"We have reached more than 8,000 catering establishments that we have taught through a vest with an artificial esophagus and stomach, how to press the abdomen,\" says Guzmán-The Mapfre Foundation urges public administrations to promote the teaching of resuscitation techniques. \"First aid should be part of the school curriculum. The efforts of the educational and health authorities should be focused on how everyone knows how to act when a crisis of this kind occurs, because saving life depends on seconds, \"says Guzmán.

information published, the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) has mobilized. He admits that he is paying attention to the situation created in two planes. On the one hand, from a financial point of view, the market supervisor wants to evaluate the patrimonial risks of this case, because of the reflection they may have in the consolidated accounts of BBVA. That is to say, if this case derives some patrimonial responsibility and if that responsibility is adequately reflected in the accounts.-On the other hand, the CNMV is analyzing the case from the point of view of the own protection of the President of this body, Manuel Conthe, and his vice-president, Carlos Arenillas, who occupied these positions during the years in which allegedly Villarejo He made the wiretaps. The CNMV wants to find out if this risk exists now in communications and in the information it manages to avoid leakage.-The market supervisor is awaiting the possible investigations that arise in this case by the police or the justice. The Commission has no capacity to check whether there were payments or hearings because it is not in its area of action. Where they can intervene is to analyze whether this issue derives some patrimonial responsibility. That is why they say they will be careful to reflect properly on the accounts. The patrimonial responsibility would be derived from any sanction or judgement of the person concerned.-After the information was published, around 16.30 pm yesterday, BBVA issued a statement in which it said: \"In relation to the information published on the Ceny Group [the company of Villarejo] that if they were true would be undoubtedly serious, BBVA It states that in June 2018 it initiated an investigation into the hiring and services provided by the company. In addition, he requested an external law firm an independent review of the facts and documentation available. Both performances are underway today. \"-The bank adds that \"if the investigations were to prove the existence of irregularities, BBVA will take the internal measures that proceed and carry out the pertinent legal actions, and as always, collaborate with the justice\".-Villarejo, imprisoned by the tandem operation, focused on its confidential reporting business, came to facilitate the content of up to 15,000 telephone calls to BBVA executives, according to the documents to which the two aforementioned media have agreed. Among the spied media is the country and one of its journalists. The accusations of politicization by the PP and the lack of support from the Bank of Spain led Sacyr to desist from his attempt to disembark at the Council of BBVA in February 2005.-This espionage, which was carried out without court order, allowed the management of BBVA to anticipate the movements of the \"hostile group\", as they baptized in key Villarejo and the entity with the circle of businessmen and politicians who allegedly tried to evict President Gonzalez. The counter-stand of the Commissioner, called \"trap\" and financed by BBVA with at least 517,600 euros, was based on underlining the involvement of the socialist government and digging into negative aspects of the \"hostile group.\"-In BBVA confirmed, weeks ago, that the entity paid five million to Commissioner Villarejo between 2012 and 2017. Asked Francisco Gonzalez about this issue in a report of the weekly country, he replied: \"That theme for me is irrelevant. So does the security Department with very strict rules. \"-When asked about whether he was aware of these payments, the president of the bank until ten days ago added: \"No. I find out when the first news comes a few months ago. I knew the bank was carrying out intelligence work to defend itself. As far as I know, things have been done as you have to do them. \"", "title_word": ["CNMV", "mobilize", "reveal", "massive", "espionage", "Villarejo", "assault", "Sacyr", "BBVA"], "subtitle_word":
