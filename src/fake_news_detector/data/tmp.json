It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don\u2019t do, to find out the real story \u2013 and the real story is that there is no pay to play.\n\n\u201cIt was natural for people who\u2019ve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn\u2019t do anything they shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN\n\nIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there\u2019s no evidence they got them.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the foundation the media doesn\u2019t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn\u2019t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.\n\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump\u2019s charitable foundation over concerns that it \u201cengaged in some impropriety\u201d as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others\u2019 contributions \u201cto make them appear to have come from him\u201d although he \u201chasn\u2019t given to the foundation since 2008.\u201d Source: Media Matters\n\nMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton\u2019s candidacy:\n\nJournalists have been criticized for the \u201cdouble standard\u201d in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton\u2019s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post\u2019s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump\u2019s Dr. Oz stunt.\n\nAll of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton \u201cscandal\u201d (if you call getting sick a \u201cscandal\u201d) while ignoring every scandal in Trump\u2019s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.\n\nFeatured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images."}, {"title": "Declassified Docs Show That Obama Admin Created ISIS In 2012 To Use As A 'Tool' \u22c6 US Herald", "url": "http://usherald.com/breaking-declassified-docs-show-that-obama-admin-created-isis-in-2012-to-use-as-a-tool?utm_source=aep&utm_medium=obamadeclassifiedisistool&utm_campaign=fbext", "text": "Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.\n\nAnd purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.\n\nAccording to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the \"leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an \u2018Islamic State\u2019 in Iraq and Syria.\u201d\n\nObviously Obama\u2019s dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a \u201cJV\u201d team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.\n\nHowever the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.\n\nAnd the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.\n\nHowever what isn\u2019t in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.\n\nHere is a link to the Judicial Watch press release detailing the released documents.\n\nHere are the released documents themselves."}, {"title": "Why is it \u201cRACIST\u201d to Question Someone\u2019s Birth Certificate? \u2013 Eagle Rising", "url": "http://eaglerising.com/36841/why-is-it-racist-to-question-someones-birth-certificate/", "text": "The Democrats are using an intimidation tactic which they are prone to use incessantly.

Consider the slanted claim that if a president is black and his birth certificate is called into question the conclusion is you must be a racist. What is wrong with this obvious non-sequitur?\n\nFirst of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist. Secondly, the social security number presented of Barack Obama was issued in Connecticut where there is no record of him domiciling there. Third, the hospital that issued his birth certificate in Hawaii didn\u2019t exist when it was \u201cissued.\u201d Fourth, an examination of the birth certificate produced several errors that could only be attributed to falsification. Has an unquestioned birth certificate ever been presented? No, only a cry of racism when the request is made.
